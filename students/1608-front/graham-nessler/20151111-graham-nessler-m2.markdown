# Graham Nessler - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goals for this module were to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and to gain more proficiency and confidence in testing, an area that I felt I was weak in at the end of Mod 1. I also wanted to increase my community involvement and to do more with professional development. I was generally successful in these goals, though testing is still something that I struggle with.

The module got off to something of a rough start with a difficult first project and then facing React, which was definitely the biggest challenge of the module. Nonetheless, I feel that I grew a great deal as a developer and as a teammate this module. I plan to focus next module on improving my React skills and on refining my focus within tech.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: TBD
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5 (I feel that my individual work was strong, but due to time constraints, I feel that I did not put forth my best efforts on the small styling projects.)
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3 (I grew as a teammate this module, but a teamwork issue with one of the projects reminded me that I still have a ways to go in this area.)
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5 (I feel much more comfortable about my efforts this mod than last mod; my company tracker is a useful tool and I wrote a couple of cold emails and went to a meetup.)
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3.5 (I feel that I was more involved in the community this mod)
