# Graham Nessler - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goals for this module were to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and to gain more proficiency and confidence in testing, an area that I felt I was weak in at the end of Mod 1. I also wanted to increase my community involvement and to do more with professional development, such as going to meetups. I was generally successful in these goals, though testing is still something that I struggle with.

The module got off to something of a rough start with a less-than-ideal result in my first project and then facing React, which was definitely the biggest challenge of the module. Nonetheless, I feel that I grew a great deal as a developer and as a teammate this module. I look forward to building my React skills next module and most of all to delving into the independent project and seeing what I can accomplish.
