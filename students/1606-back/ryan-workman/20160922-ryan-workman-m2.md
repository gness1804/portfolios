# Ryan Workman - M2 Portfolio: ActiveRecord Strikes Back
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Better understand HTML and CSS, using fundamentals of web design.  I really enjoy ruby and back-end languages, but, as I learned doing the pre-work over the intermission week, I am not very good at bending CSS to create stylish and good-looking webpages.  This module, I want to build on top of the back-end skills I learned last mod and learn how to create nice and aesthetically pleasing pages.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Notes
* percent_correct uses a zipped array (test text and attempt text) reduce with an if statement broken out into separate methods
* Started by writing a test. Might not have needed to rewrite the test once it was clear how similar they were.
* Needed some prompting on creating test data and not touring the application to create attempts.
#### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them
#### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
* 4: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer
#### 3. Rails Syntax & API
* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance
#### 4. MVC & Rails Style
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack
#### 5. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development with guidance
#### 6. Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Work

It was an uphill battle, as information relentlessly flew at us.  For six weeks, my cohort banded together to fight the onslaught of new concepts to understand and implement them.  It wasn't easy, but enough repetition, we began to get a handle of the code before more information hit us.  The following projects demonstrate the efforts put forth to win the battle.

#### LittleShop - No Refunds Travel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

No Refunds Travel isn't just our name... It's our business philosophy.
Dan, Matt and I used all of the information and tools we were given all module to put together a fully-functional e-commerece site.  Looking back at my 'Areas of Emphasis' written at the beginning of the module, I can say with certainty that I have grown and created an aesthetically pleasing site.

#### RushHour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kctrlv/rush-hour/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Using Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord, we built a basic web traffic tracking and analysis tool.  Over the course of one week Calaway, David and I dove into ActiveRecord and Sinatra, learning the ins and outs of the HTTP call-and-response cycle.  Despite some struggles, we eventually overcame our differences and learned how to work together to build a fully-functional product.

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

#### Feedback to Me
* Calaway - Ryan, you were awesome to work with on Rush Hour. You have an uncanny ability to see a solution to a problem immediately. At that point you'll often do a code spike to get to that solution quickly. Once you have a good idea you'll bear down and get to the solution with amazing speed and determination. This shows astonishing intelligence and imagination for creative problem solving and should not be discounted.
There are two downsides I see to this methodology. First is that it often lacks a master plan and, while solving the problems, can leave your code without the structure you ultimately want, not as readable as you want, and untested. Second, it can leave your team behind, because while it can make sense when it is explained, it is often not understood until each person has their hands on the keyboard while writing it.
My recommendation would be to continue doing these code spikes, because they're an incredible asset to you and your teams. (Note that I wouldn't recommend this to everybody, but I definitely do for your particular style.) However, I would do it on a separate branch and never merge it into the final code. I would use the spike solely as reference material, and then re-write it with your team from scratch. This way you can go to the whiteboard for the structure, write tests before the code, and have the whole team writing the final code.
We did exactly this during one phase of our project, but there was at least one other time that I wish we would have and didn't. I should have stated this at the time and I'll work on voicing such things in future projects.
Your energy and excitement are contagious. It's fun spending time punching out code with you. You also happen to kick-ass at it. Don't discount your own abilities. Be proud of them.
* David - Ryan, Rush Hour was stressful for us both, and I think the root cause was a lack of meaningful and constructive communication from both sides. Our work styles did not mesh, there were many instances where I disagreed with where the project was being steered, which caused conflicts. You are a passionate and opinionated programmer, and you have the drive to steer a project. If I could offer a critical piece of feedback, I would ask you to consider the input of your teammates more before pushing forward with a strategy that the whole team has to work with. Despite some rough edges, I learned a lot from working with you, specifically that I need to be less protective of a group project than a solo one and trust my teammates and their code more. Thank you Ryan for your hard work in the project, without which we would have not succeeded. I know it was a learning experience for both of us, and I welcome more in the future.

#### Rails MiniProject - Robo-World-Domination

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/robo-world-domination)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

One weekend to put it all together.  I chose to do my own version of the Rails MiniProject.  I wanted to build off of RobotWorld and add users which can build their own platoons and challenge other users.  I learned a lot of information building this app.  While there is little-to-no U.I., I had so much fun digging into the engine and learning what pieces fit where and how I could bend rails to my will.  I did not complete any extensions, but I did build basic combat algorithms and implemented full authorization and CRUD functionality.

#### BookShelf

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/book_shelf)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/forms_primer.markdown)

BookShelf was a great project to get a lot of reps in on authorization and authentication.  I spent several hours one day trudging through the code, understanding the intricacies involved in logging in a user and permitting a user to see certain pages.  It wasn't until the end of BookShelf that I began to gain confidence in my basic web development skills.

#### CRUD Sprint

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/CRUD_sprint)

Given 90 minutes, I was told to test my skills at developing a basic app that has one table and full CRUD functionality.  I gained a lot of confidence and was surprised that I was able to bust out a fully CRUD'd table in just around 45 minutes.  This was also the project that made me realize that I could write feature tests and use RSpec.

#### MixMaster

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/mix-master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

It was a walk in the park... or, at least a walkthrough in the park.  At times, this beast of a walkthrough seemed never-ending, but after an extended weekend of implementing this code, I can confidently say that I walked away with a whole lot more knowledge than I had when it started.  MixMaster introduced many new concepts and opened my eyes to the sheer power hiding inside rails.

#### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

Making my own blog site... with the help of a great tutorial.  Blogger walked me through the intricacies of database relations and how to call and manipulate data saved on a database.

#### RobotWorld

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/robot-world)

You gotta start somewhere.  RobotWorld is the first real project in the Module using YAML and eventually converting over to SQLite3.  A great way to get a feel for the waters that are web development.

### Giving Feedback

* Calaway - Navigating the traffic jam that is RushHour... Calaway, you are a great person to work with, and I would really enjoy pairing with you on another project in the future.  Anytime we had to put our heads down and bust out code, you were more than willing to sit down and figure out the problem.  I really appreciate your ability to speak up and challenge other viewpoints.  You have incredible ideas, and I encourage you to be more vocal to get those ideas across.  Overall, I can say that I will continually bounce ideas off you for the rest of our time at Turing.  Thanks for being an even-keeled, understanding beacon even during the most troubling of storms.
* David - Navigating the traffic jam that is RushHour... David, it goes without saying, we had a tough time getting through this project.  Overall, I really appreciate your knack for simplistic, readable code.  While we clashed over specific coding styles and practices, in the end, we both wanted to deliver the very best product we could.  I think that you could be better at compromising style and workflow to better serve the group.  Specifically, there were times when I felt Calaway and I decided on a route to perceive and you would come in and fight it relentlessly.  With that being said, I know I need to get better at communicating and speaking up when I'm uneasy.  We had a lot of breakdowns in communication, and I think we can both get better at that over our next few months at Turing.  Overall, your attention to detail definitely gives me a lot to strive for, and I think you can add a lot to any group you are in.
* Susi - It's rare that you come across someone as motivated and relentless as you, Susi.  As you know, you have a been helping me all Module.  Your words of encouragement and constant reminders that the rules matter have made me a better coder.  Overall, I think it would pay-off ten-fold if you turned that motivation and confidence inward.  I can honestly tell you that you are much better at writing code and problem solving that I am, but your fear of making mistakes holds you back from experimenting and unlocking the shear power of coding.  As I always tell you, remember what Miss Frizzle says, "Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!"  You have the ability and the potential to become one of the best in the biz, and I can't wait until you see it.
* Dan - Dan, I am so glad we were placed in the same group for LittleShop.  Working on No Refunds has been one of the most enjoyable projects yet.  I know I've told you this in person, but your calm, easy-going personality is such a great balance for groups.  Specifically, I have learned a lot working with you.  As you know, I have a tendency to get a bit wound up when I get excited, you are really good at keeping the group's emotions down and, in turn, calm me down.  The one bit of advice I could give you though, is being calm can be a double-edged sword.  There were moments when I would ask how you were feeling about some of the code we were writing, and I think it would be beneficial if you spoke up a little more and expressed your opinions.  Overall though, you are a fantastic group member to work with and solid coder.  I'm glad we were able to get this website off the ground.  It's one of the first projects I am honestly proud to put my name on.
* Matt - It's crazy how slow, yet how fast six weeks go by.  Matt, it was just six weeks ago that you joined our cohort, and, I have to say, I think all of us are so much better off with you here.  We have paired several times throughout the Module, not to mention our LittleShop group.  One of the best parts working with you is your ability to slow down and think of all angles while solving a problem.  I can't even count how many awesome functions we have in LittleShop that wouldn't have been possible without you.  I don't really have any criticisms; I have honestly worked well with you and learned a lot.  You are good at collaborating, speaking out when you have a gripe or want a better understanding, and self-aware.  I guess I would just say your confidence could be a little higher.  I definitely think your coding ability is far ahead of where your confidence is at, as soon as those align, you'll be a force to be reckoned with.

### Being a Community Member

* Susi - Ryan is a backbone of our Module. His enthusiasm, passion for helping others succeed, and absolute unending curiosity is unreal. I have paired with Ryan on multiple occasions over the course of 2 modules. He is the first to tell me to be brave and just try something in my code. He is the first to remind me that no matter what, I am capable of anything. Ryan's participation with SAB this module has only further cemented his passion for Turing, our community, and his learning. He has co-run our retros every week and just shines in this role. He loves his module, his work, his community, and his friends. At times his enthusiasm does get the best of him and the curiosity that fuels his learning also leads him astray of the requirements in a spec. If he can direct his passion into staying on track with the spec he will go even further than he already has. Ryan comes up with ways to solve problems that are just mind-blowing. On multiple occasions I have asked him, "how the heck does your mind work?..."
* Dan - Ryan, you were awesome to work with on the Little Shop project.  Your enthusiasm, energy, and creativity made what could have been potentially uninteresting project a lot of fun.  You did a great job listening to group input and keeping the group moving in the right direction.  There was also a specific instance where I felt that you could tell I didn’t quite understand the name-spacing technique we were using and you made sure I got the practice I needed to understand it.  You have a great ability to understand what is going on in the Rails app all at once, and are a great asset to the team.  I’m looking forward to working with you again, hopefully on something a little less structured.
* Matt - Ryan and I had to opportunity to work together on our second group project, called Little Shop, and were paired together multiple times in class to work through exercises or to evaluate each other’s projects.  I was immediately impressed by Ryan’s work and intellectual abilities. Ryan was our project manager for Little Shop, and time and time again his understanding of how the pieces fit together proved valuable. I appreciated Ryan making sure everyone was involved in the process because I know he was trying to stretch himself to be a part of, and build a more cohesive team.  He continually tries to do things better than the last time, and this project proved how he can bring a team together.  As far as I can see, Ryan will make a great programmer and leader in the industry as he keeps asking for feedback and stays responsive to others he works with.

### Playing a Part

Overall, I have increased my community participation 10-fold.  I have been making a conscious effort to get out of my shell and put myself in uncomfortable situations.  Not only have I been a major part in some of the most integral parts of Turing itself, I have also been seeking ways to increase public involvement with Turing.  Below is a list of some of the things I have done over the past 6 weeks.

* Student Advisory Board Representative
* Leading Miyamoto Posse
* Referring my sister's organization (Kids Adventures) to Turing for a "Kids Who Code" style code-along
* Pairing with Module 1 students to help them better understand Ruby

### Gear Up Takeaways

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

I am so grateful that Turing felt it necessary for us all to watch this film.  I am obviously new to the tech industry and am still taken back at how openly hostile some organizations are towards women.  After the film, my group discussed the merits of inclusion and how to reach out to those with differing opinions.

#### There is an I in Team

My group chose to discuss the belief of ghosts.  At first, I thought the discussion was kind of silly, but as each of us repeated other members in our group, I realized that my opinions were not necessarily a general consensus.  At the end of the exercise, I walked away with a better understanding of how to actively listen to other opinions different than mine and see merits in other arguments.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?
  * I'm always reminding myself that I've only been doing this for a few months, and I am sure to celebrate the progress I have made over the past few months.
  * I have a tendency to compare myself to other people who have a lot more experience than I have.
* How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
  * It shows that practice enforces habits.  The more time you take doing drills and just basic coding pays off 10-fold.
* What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?
  * My emotional state plays a huge role in learning.  When I am in a distraught state, I tend to not focus on the task at hand and dwell over whatever is affecting me.
  * I am working on getting out of my fixed mindset.  Traditionally, failures destroy me and make me feel stupid.  In reality, failures should make me happy and motivated to learn more.

## Job Prep

### Project Management Strategies
After spending time with Allison, I learned several great methods to increase productivity as a project manager.  On LittleShop, I stepped up to the plate to be the project manager.  Using the skills Allison taught us, the management of this project was ten-times better than projects in the past.  We all utilized stand ups and retros to express factual, non-personal criticisms and pushed each other to get better and perform at our optimal level.
On a personal level, I've been continually pushing myself to remember to "step back" from a stressful situation and assume positive intent.  I have been striving to take my emotions out of conflicts, allowing a more constructive dialogue.
Overall, I can say that Allison's classes and techniques have made all of us better at communicating with each other and offering feedback/ criticisms.
