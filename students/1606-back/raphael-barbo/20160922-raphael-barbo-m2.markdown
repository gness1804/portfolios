# Raphael Barbo - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

During module 2, I had set myself with two main goals; The first was to give back to the community, participate in gear ups, and spend a good amount of hours pairing with module 1 (which I believe I have succeeded). The second goal was to really dive into Ruby, Sinatra, and Rails. I wanted to get a really good preparation for module 3, and make sure I got a solid understanding and foundation of the conceptual approaches to Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails, as well as applied skills for projects and exercises.

#### Feedback From Teammates:

**Brendan Dillon:** I worked with Raphael on our Rush Hour project. The biggest thing that stood out to me about Raphael was his energy and dedication to getting things done. We wound up working pretty long days on Rush Hour, not just because Raphael would want to keep going, but because he would be enthusiastic about continuing and that carried throughout the group. He is also a really strong programmer who would come up with some great ideas. However, he sometimes underestimated himself and was not very confident about conveying what he was thinking about. While his communication in general was really strong, he did sometimes struggle to communicate his ideas, and I think that being more sure of them would help.

**Dan Broadbent:** Raphael - I was happy to have you as a partner on the Rush Hour project.  You brought a great energy to our group, and made it easy to stay and get work done when we were all on a roll.  You obviously have great technical skills, but beyond that your positive attitude helped us all tackle difficult challenges with relative ease because we were all on the same page and having fun working together.  This group worked very well together and your openness and communication was a big part of that.  Can’t wait to work with you again.

#### Feedback From Teammates:

**Jasmin Hudacsek:** I am happy to have gotten the opportunity to work with Rapha this module and get to know him better than I had the chance to in Module 1. Rapha pulled his weight AND THEN SOME in our Little Shop project and I couldn’t be any more impressed with his work ethic. He was always willing to work late and always asking how he could help if I was feeling overwhelmed with my own tasks. He has a very versatile skillset and is a Googling master if he’s not sure how to do something. His sense of humor also helped to keep the group morale high during stressful times, so I’m very thankful for that. I would be fortunate to get the opportunity to partner with Rapha again. 

**Jean Joeris:** Raphael has been an awesome team member. He is always willing keep working. His work experience prior to turing shines through in his excellent work ethic and positive attitude. He even volunteered to give me a ride to and from Turing one weekend. He is a very capable coder, but doesn't let that stop him from asking for help. He has no ego about seeking help when necessary. His willingness to keep working was a huge boon to the team, as he helped make sure cards were getting done. He was always happy to take on whatever task was needed. A few times it seemed to me he was so focused to move the project forward that he didn't voice his concerns as clearly as he could have. This is not to imply he doesn't communicate well, the vast majority of the time he was voiced himself clearly. Raphael is extremely kind and was a joy to work with.

#### Reflection About GearUps

* I believe GearUps are an important part of Turing's identity, and those sessions are of extreme value for those looking to impact the tech industry in a constructive and productive way.
* In addition to my previous points, I believe that GearUp could be improved with some more actionable approaches.  For example, rather than simply talking about issues (which often times is not that simple), trying throughout a module to come up with real actions that will have an impact in the commmunity, school, and its students.
* I honestly believe that Beth has improved the quality of the conversations to a whole other level, and I sincerely believe we will see the community engagement grow as the modules progress.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

(takeaways from session)

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
- Always extremely insightful, Allison reinforced the importance and good habits of constructive feedback. I feel like her tips were of extreme value, and I can thank her for the two successful experiences I have had throughout Module 2.

2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
- I learned that I need to voice my opinion more often, and that I can add more value to teams (more often than sometimes I expect of give myself credit for). I am working on opening new channels of communication.

#### Networking with Lia (Finding Opportunities & Branding Yourself)

* [Gist with 10 companies and contacts](https://gist.github.com/rsbarbo/f46ae31575cdefe280549dc5396dc86f)

Lia is an amazing communicator, and the info sessions with her have been extremely refreshing for me. As someone who have been in charging of hiring at a completely different industry, I feel like Lia always brings great points to taken into consideration. Her tips on how to make connections through LinkedIn were super helpful and I am looking forward to applying them throughout my job search.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* I could not go this module without giving Ben a major shoutout for the amazing work done during his pairing sessions, as well as seeing his dedication and willingness to learn more and more every single day throughout the module. I am super happy to have Ben in my cohort, and I honestly have a lot of admiration, and respect for everything he does. Raphael Barbo (Feedback given to Ben Pepper)

* Seeing how much Nate has grown as developer has motivated me more than ever to push myself to the next level. I have great admiration for Nate's dedication, hard-work, and work-ethic, and it is inspiring to see how much progress he has made in just a few weeks of the module 2. Thank you for being an amazing human being Nate. You are a true inspiration. Raphael Barbo (Feedback given to Nate Anderson)

* Sonia was a true inspiration this module, I have seen her dedicate some much time to get to the level of knowledge and expertise that she is in now, and it goes to show that hard-work, dedication, and willingness to learn can take you really far in life. She is a sweet caring person, and I am glad she decided to rejoin in the 1606 cohort. Raphael Barbo (Feedback to Sonia Gupta)

### Being a Community Member

* Raphael was my go to person to pair with when signing up for one v ones with people from mod 2. He is able to explain concepts in a way with out stealing my learning. I can tell being relatable and empathetic are two skills that Raphael has really mastered and made learning from him a pleasure. Multiple times we ran over our allotted time but he refused to end the session until I understood the topic. At the same time he always is laughing/having fun and brings a great vibe to Turing. (Anthony Ciccone - Md 1)

* Raphael always has a smile on his face and a kind word to encourage anyone who he is around. His positivity and friendly demeanor has been of great comfort several times through Turing. His drive to learn more and to be better then the previous day is inspiring and being in the same cohort as Raphael has been a great boost for my outlook. He is a great asset to have at Turing.(Ben Pepper - Md 2) 

* Raphael is an incredibly solid person. He has compassion, wit, and tremendous insight into human nature. He has often shown me kindness during hard times. His willingness to push through regardless of the difficulty he may be facing is a testament to his resilience. He is an example for other students, and I'm glad to have the opportunity to learn with him. (Sonia Gupta - Md 2) 

### Playing a Part

- This module I really wanted to give back to community by pairing as much as possible with module 1 students, and I have gladly accomplished this goal.
- I have being trying to play a role in promoting Turing on Social Media, from Facebook to Twitter, I am willing to share with people this amazing experience I am living, and how thankful I am for having this opportunity.
- Gear Ups and Community Days.
- Attended Denver StartUp Week and events.
