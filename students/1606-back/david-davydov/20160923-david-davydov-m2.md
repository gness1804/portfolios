### Areas of Emphasis

In this module, my main goal was to get a solid foundation and familiarity with
web technologies. Mod1 gave me the confidence in writing ruby programs in the
terminal, and I aim to establish the same confidence in developing web apps. I
also decided to gain some exposure to Machine Learning. Joining the Armstrong Posse
along with signing up for the Stanford Machine Learning course provided a solid
foundation to educating myself about this area.

### Work

The projects in Module 2 exposed me to the basics of Rails applications. The path from Robot World (A basic CRUD application in Sinatra) to Waddams Emporium (A shopping cart application with styling and a full test suite) was filled with both happiness and pain. Most importantly, the group projects gave me the git-flow and collaboration experience that I could not have gained anywhere else.

#### Sinatra CRUD: Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kctrlv/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown)

* This was a small CRUD application that had robots and their auto-generated images. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department.


#### Mix Master
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kctrlv/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

* This was a tutorial-built application that had multiple resources working together. Concepts that were solidified with this tutorial were database relationships and associations.

### Projects

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kctrlv/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRBtlGpn8MuaZlwC7EUIDwKaNC3pWuXmfCvHTB8pdRQ/edit#)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1606-b/rush_hour/calaway_ryan_david.md)

Rush hour was a 3-person group project. Some key concepts were parsing raw JSON for individual clients in order to then analyze and present the client information about their site.

#### Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

####. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

####. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

####. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### View Layer
* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view


### Gear Up

I appreciated this module's Gear Up events. Although we are here to learn programming, having a Friday to do other things such as grow as developers and human beings is a welcome feature of Turing. I included a lengthy feedback to the CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap that I will include below:

* I think it’s very positive that people decided to make steps to change a culture because it has not been working for them. The world is everyone’s, and everyone has a right to it. I see everyone at Turing as part of one community. I know some may assume we’re all here ultimately for ourselves (and in the future, our companies) but I think that’s a default mindset we’re taught is normal so we assume we’re just all heading down that path. After these two mods I did gain a little bit of an appreciation of what Turing is trying to do with these classes. I do want to say that continued discussion is not bad when it’s opt-in. The reason a lot of people want to opt-out is because they want to put all of their efforts into studying programming and these discussions only serve to distract from that goal, and I understand that - Turing can get heavy at times - but the efforts at community building is something I'm glad to be a part of.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?

  * Rush Hour and Little Shop were the most valuable experiences of Module 2 for me for completely different reasons. In Rush Hour, I received feedback along the lines of picking my own battles, only questioning the decisions of my group when appropriate and being more flexible with regard to the project flow. I incorporated that attitude into my Little Shop group and the results couldn't have been better. The workflow of our team was smooth throughout the project, and while everyone at Turing is smart and determined, our group project leader Jesse professionally demonstrated throughout the project what it takes to be a leader.

2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
  * Having been a part of a group that barely got by, and a group that blew the project out of the water, I've learned howI best fit into the picture of a programming team. In Mod-1, we were all asked the question: "What do you want to get out of Turing?" I remember answering that I wanted to learn how to work better in a team, and these two projects have aided my growth in this area more than anything before. I know now to be more calm, focused, and trusting of my teammates. Being able to go through other people's code has become easier, and figuring out solutions in their code as opposed to just offering my own is a skill I have recently acquired and will seek to always improve.

#### Networking with Lia

Networking with my classmates took all the fear out of potentially networking in real life. We had three sessions of 5-minute pairings where we would talk about ourselves and answer questions, before switching the focus on the our partner. By the end of the session, I had improved my delivery but was so excited that I learned a good bit of critical feedback from one of my partners - that my eye contact could use improvement. This was a strong session, and I would love to see more of these kinds of classes in the future.

### Giving Feedback

* To: Calaway, Project: Rush Hour
> Calaway, I feel that our team benefited tremendously from your grounded, level-headed work style. Doing Rush Hour as a three person group was not easy. We did not have the most efficient way to approach it right away, but your input during the three-person-pairing sessions always steered us in the right direction. Pairing with you at union station that day felt very productive and enjoyable. As a small bit of critical feedback, I would love to see you offer your opinion within your team more. It sometimes felt like your voice was the least shared in our group. You are a smart guy, and a pleasure to work with. Thank you for keeping a calm head throughout and having the patience to support the team through to the end, I would love to work with you again.

* To: Ryan, Project: Rush Hour
> Ryan, Rush Hour was stressful for us both, and I think the root cause was a lack of meaningful and constructive communication from both sides. Our work styles did not mesh, there were many instances where I disagreed with where the project was being steered, which caused conflicts. You are a passionate and opinionated programmer, and you have the drive to steer a project. If I could offer a critical piece of feedback, I would ask you to consider the input of your teammates more before pushing forward with a strategy that the whole team has to work with. Despite some rough edges, I learned a lot from working with you, specifically that I need to be less protective of a group project than a solo one and trust my teammates and their code more. Thank you Ryan for your hard work in the project, without which we would have not succeeded. I know it was a learning experience for both of us, and I welcome more in the future.

* To: Jesse, Project: Little Shop
>Jesse is a natural leader. In fact, working with Jesse was the first time at Turing that I learned what a team leader on a group project should look like. This project was Jesse's baby and we were all raising it together. Jesse took the reigns of this project from the first day, and never let go. In all of his interactions with the group, he would always act professionally and was never sour to anyone, or made anyone feel like they were less than him. He has a strict, determined tone of voice when someone else is driving that always brought us back on track when a distraction arose. Jesse would always strive to improve the project in a myriad of small ways, all on his time. Particularly during the end, we encountered a bug in the code that broke our "Logout" button. It was late, and we had to have the project ready. Instead of giving up and reverting to a past working commit, Jesse pushed through with the team and fixed the bug. There were many other instances where Jesse would go home after 7-8pm when we were stuck on a problem, and then post the solution to slack at 10pm. I could tell that he has a strong passion for this kind of work, and I'll never forget this experience. Thank you Jesse for being an amazing partner, I know you will continue to enlighten every team you work with.

* To: Susi, Project: Little Shop
>Susi is a very talented programmer and human being. She is funny, kind, and always knows the right thing to say. Having her in our group was a breath of fresh air, and whether we were reviewing code with the rest of our group, or pairing, working with Susi was always pleasant. Susi has a knack for caring about people. She would always be genuinely interested in how I was doing, and I always appreciated her kindness and willingness to make sure I was alright. From the get-go, Susi was determined to have a strong impact on the project. On day one, she committed to doing the site’s wireframes and had them ready the next day. Every day Susi made herself available during the day, evening, and even some nights for screenhero pairing. Susie’s commitment to the team, her never-slowing performance, and her compassion make her a fun and energetic teammate to work with.

* To: Sonia, Project: Little Shop
>I once told Sonia that she was a cyborg, and I still think this may partly be true. What impressed me about Sonia more than anything was her ability to hold massive amounts of information in her head, make sense of it all, and when she didn't know something she would know the right place to reference it. She is an organizational master. Often during our project, I would know that we'd need to use a technique we learned in a random lesson some odd days ago. Whenever I would ask her where I could reference this technique, she wouldn't hesitate before responding with the right answer. My pairing experience with Sonia was always positive. There was a moment during the project that the approach we were taking was getting complicated and I suggested that we slow down and try another way. My delivery is something I could work on, and when what I said came off as off-putting, Sonia let me know and I appreciated it. I reminded Sonia that I always recognized her super-human commitment and dedication to the team. I would be excited to work with and learn more from Sonia in the future, she is a strong resource to any group she works with.

### Being a Community Member

* From: Calaway, Project: Rush Hour
>David, it was awesome working with you on Rush Hour. Your ability to give good structure to your code is something I was able to learn from and improve in my own projects. Your intelligence and problem solving abilities are incredibly impressive and our team benefitted greatly from it. I do have two small points of actionable constructive criticism, and they tie in to one another. The first is to be more flexible when appropriate, and the second is to pick your battles. I think it is always best that everybody clearly voices their opinion on how to go about an particular problem. Then if there is some disagreement, have an expectation of using your proposed method some portion of the time, and then using an opposing method some other portion of the time. When I saw you being more flexible and concede certain points, then in a later situation when you would 'pick your battle' and stand up for an opposing idea it became much easier to listen to your point very closely and want to agree to go down that path together. I don't think that you were necessarily bad at either of these points, but I do think it could be beneficial to be aware of them while working on group projects. You have a great attitude and excitement toward programming and it makes it fun to work on projects together. I appreciated your awesome work ethic and I would consider myself lucky to pair with you again on a later project.

* From: Ryan, Project: Rush Hour
>David, it goes without saying, we had a tough time getting through this project.  Overall, I really appreciate your knack for simplistic, readable code.  While we clashed over specific coding styles and practices, in the end, we both wanted to deliver the very best product we could.  I think that you could be better at compromising style and workflow to better serve the group.  Specifically, there were times when I felt Calaway and I decided on a route to perceive and you would come in and fight it relentlessly.  With that being said, I know I need to get better at communicating and speaking up when I'm uneasy.  We had a lot of breakdowns in communication, and I think we can both get better at that over our next few months at Turing.  Overall, your attention to detail definitely gives me a lot to strive for, and I think you can add a lot to any group you are in.

* From: Susi, Project: Little Shop
>David is a hidden gem in our cohort. He is so quiet and reserved, but I learned pretty quickly that all that quietness is just because he is always thinking a few steps ahead. His ability to calmly and carefully work through an issue is great. David is amazing at Git Workflow - specifically on Merge Conflicts. His calm way of reading through the errors and conflicts that makes the repair of the conflicts seem painless. David was an amazing group and pairing partner. I would encourage David to speak up when he sees or hears something that does not sit quite right with him. There were a few moments during the project where he would speak up about a point of confusion or contention within the group, but since it seemed he was thinking on and about it for awhile, his tone was a bit abrasive. His ideas and solutions for these problems were spot on just about every time, but the impact of the delivery can sometimes be challenging. David really understands the code and the projects. He is super determined and extremely talented. I am so excited that I finally got to work with him and get to know him better.

* From: Sonia, Project: Little Shop
>I was really lucky to have the chance to work with David during Little Shop. He often spots issues that others miss, and he is very insightful. He has a generally calm demeanor which is particularly helpful when coding gets stressful. I particularly appreciate David’s receptiveness to feedback. There was a moment during our project where I felt that I David was questioning me in a way that implied I did not know what I was doing. I brought it up with him and he was incredibly receptive. He did not get defensive, and he went to Starbucks and brought me back a croissant. I really appreciated that, and it made me respect him even more. Ultimately, I had a really great experience pairing with David. I think he just got better and better as a team mate during our project, and I hope I get to work with him again.

* From: Jesse

David's Strenghts

David's strengths are wide ranging, impressive, and contributed significantly to my own learning and the completion of our Little Shop project. In fact, at this point I would say that pairing with David has been my most positive paring experience so far at Turing. A few strengths that stood out in particular for me are:

* Commitment, evidenced by his willingness to dedicate long hours throughout the project and in particular on the first Saturday, when he moved apartments and then came directly to Turing to work.

* Positivity towards others, evidenced by the multiple occasions I heard him say he learned something from each member of the team.

* Ability to check himself and his team on rabbit hole shenanigans.

* Team-first mindset, evidenced by go with the flow attitude (not in a uncaring way, but in a manner that projected a belief that the team's needs were most important) during team check-ins.

On the technical side, David also has a considerable skill set including

* Speed on the computer. He is the first non-instructor I've worked with at Turing who makes me feel slow on a keyboard.

* Feature driven development. David is very comfortable beginning with a user story (either given or created), creating a feature test, and then implementing a solution.

Area of growth

* In terms of an area of growth, I would challenge David to not settle for good-enough code because he has the technical chops to always produce products and solutions of the highest quality.

### Playing a Part

* I signed myself up to pairing sessions but the competition was stiff and I did not get any interest.

* I attended and participated in Armstrong posse meetings every week, contributing what I learned to the group.

* I diligently cleaned the big workspace every week as my cleaning duty.

* I participated in lunch roulettes, and never missed a gear-up or any Friday community content.
