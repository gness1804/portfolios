## C: Group Work & Projects

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)
* [DTR](https://gist.github.com/bheim6/77c8d48123493e9c8aebd887d8afaf3d)
* [Blog Post](http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/8/29/rush-hour)

__Rush Hour__ The project is about using Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web tracking and analysis web service. The web service allows a user to send a post request to register as a client. Once a client registers they can send a post request with receiving data, which we call a payload. Our job was to write code to accept the submission of these payloads, analyze the data submitted, and then display the data on a web page..

##### Feedback from team

Working with Jesse on his project has been a great experience, His major strengths are regarding his hard skills and ability to explain his thought process. He is a master of his tools and is adept with shortcuts and workflow. He is a strong communicator and is able to explain the reasons behind every coding decision. I learned alot about TDD form him on this project. I considered myself solid with TDD, but Jesse is an expert, and emphasized encapsulation and helper methods. It was really nice working with someone who was able to advance my own skill in this area.

The constructive advice I would give Jesse would be to not stress about project deadlines so much. In addition, for him to not worry if his progress or understanding doesn't quite match someone in another group, if he can accomplish this, he will be unstoppable.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

[GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

* Being good at learning and persisting through uncertainty is one of the most important skills a developer can hope to grow.
* Managing emotional health makes one more likely to succeed at learning and increases one's stamina for persisting through uncertainty.

#### There Is An I In Team

[GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

* Setting expectations are important. When teammates have different visions for how a project will proceed, it's tough to succeed. In our small group conversation, my partners brought various levels of engagement into the discussion. Only after we reflected on our collective goals did the conversation turn in a more productive direction.

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

[GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

* The notion of death by 1000 cuts made a lot of sense. If someone has a reaction to a provocation that at first glance seems disproportionate to the cause, it could be that the cause is just the tipping point in a long string of similar issues.
* I am responsible for actively opposing sexism in the work place.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

##### The project management strategies I used with Little Shop were:

 __Communicating a vision for the end product and goal__ I tried to keep the team's focus on the big picture of what we needed to accomplish, what we wanted to learn, and what obstacles we would need to overcome to achieve those ends. Individual implementation challenges were best handled by a single person or pair of teammates so as not to slow progress in other areas.

 __Checking in with the team as a group and individually__ Keeping tabs on where the team was at as a group was accomplished through agile stand-up meetings that happened at least once if not two or three times daily. The meetings were brief and focused on each group member's next steps. Each meeting ended with a review of the team's progress in the context of the entire project. I also checked in with individual teammates to make sure I understood their ideas and could find ways to best utilize their strengths and interests towards the common goals of the team.

 __Being authentic__ In addition to focusing on the goal of delivering a successful project, I also took an authentic interest in the well-being of my team. I cared about their frustrations and anxieties. I tried to be myself as much as possible. I tried to lead by example. I tried to ask questions, elicit opinions, and build consensus in lieu of dictating next steps.

There were other project management practices I employed during Little Shop, but they feel less like strategies and more like tools or techniques. These include:
* Recording issues in GitHub
* Assigning issues to team members
* Categorizing and prioritizing issues
* Segregating technical and logistical communication; we used Github or the technical, we used Slack for non-technical


##### Incorporating Feedback

* The feedback I got from Rush Hour was to manage my anxieties better. I think I did a good job keeping calm throughout Little Shop.

#### Networking with Lia

* Ask people about their work
* Start making connections now

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Sonia
###### Strengths
Sonia's strengths are wide ranging, impressive, and contributed significantly to my own learning and the completion of our Little Shop project. A few that stood out in particular for me are:
* Verbal communication evidenced by clear explanation of thought during pairing sessions and team stand-ups.
* Written communication evidenced by her note taking, which the entire team referenced throughout the project, as well as her issue reporting, commit messages, responses to other team member's commit messages, and Slack.
* Analytical thought / logical reasoning, evidenced by her linguistic precision and bug squashing.
* Humor, which makes pairing with her a pleasure.
* Asking questions to find answers, evidenced by her deft use of Google search and Stack overflow.

Also on the technical side, Sonia was directly responsible for implementing a number of challenging features on our project including cart creation order placement. The team also relied on her Heroku technical knowledge.
###### Area of growth
In terms of an area of growth, I would like to see Sonia apologize less - out of all the times I heard her apologize when working with her, I don't think I can think of a single instance that she did anything wrong or worth apologizing over. Part of that might come from not having confidence in her technical skill set, which is considerable.
#### Susi's
###### Strengths
Susi's strengths are wide ranging, impressive, and contributed significantly to my own learning and the completion of our Little Shop project. A few that stood out in particular for me are:
* Positive mindset in the face of uncertainty and or challenge. Throughout the project, Susi was a wellspring of positivity.
* Emotional intelligence evidenced by her ability to read other's feelings and show empathy and compassion.
* Humor, which makes pairing with her a pleasure.

On the technical side, Susi is highly proficient with html, css, and Bootstrap. She single handedly implemented a controller refactor that employed our project's only module. She also paired on multiple difficult challenges including order creation, photo upload, review editing, and authentication.
###### Area of growth
In terms of an area of growth, I would challenge Susi to continue to push herself to drive during pairing sessions and aggressively seek opportunities to solo implementation.
#### David's
###### Strengths
David's strengths are wide ranging, impressive, and contributed significantly to my own learning and the completion of our Little Shop project. In fact, at this point I would say that pairing with David has been my most positive paring experience so far at Turing. A few strengths that stood out in particular for me are:
* Commitment, evidenced by his willingness to dedicate long hours throughout the project and in particular on the first Saturday, when he moved apartments and then came directly to Turing to work.
* Positivity towards others, evidenced by the multiple occasions I heard him say he learned something from each member of the team.
* Ability to check himself and his team on rabbit hole shenanigans.
* Team-first mindset, evidenced by go with the flow attitude (not in a uncaring way, but in a manner that projected a belief that the team's needs were most important) during team check-ins.

On the technical side, David also has a considerable skill set including
* Speed on the computer. He is the first non-instructor I've worked with at Turing who makes me feel slow on a keyboard.
* Feature driven development. David is very comfortable beginning with a user story (either given or created), creating a feature test, and then implementing a solution.

###### Area of growth
In terms of an area of growth, I would challenge David to not settle for good-enough code because he has the technical chops to always produce products and solutions of the highest quality.

### Being a Community Member

#### Brian H.
* Working with Jesse on his project has been a great experience, His major strengths are regarding his hard skills and ability to explain his thought process. He is a master of his tools and is adept with shortcuts and workflow. He is a strong communicator and is able to explain the reasons behind every coding decision. I learned alot about TDD form him on this project. I considered myself solid with TDD, but Jesse is an expert, and emphasized encapsulation and helper methods. It was really nice working with someone who was able to advance my own skill in this area.
* The constructive advice I would give Jesse would be to be mindful about managing stress regarding project deadlines. He never let it get in the way of the project, but could become distracted at times when overhearing other groups discuss how far along they were on the project. If he can accomplish this, he will be unstoppable.

#### Susi
Jesse is a natural leader, organizer, and developer. His troubleshooting and problem solving skills are among some of the best I have ever seen. His attention to detail and desire to succeed is stunning. During Little Shop Jesse was our fearless Project Manager; he never hesitated to help our group come to a decision and always urged us to try to do more than we believed we could. His desire to succeed, although inspiring, can also be a bit intimidating. This was evident in his successful efforts to style buttons on a few pages in Little Shop with icons. Thought this determination is admirable, it can also be frustrating to team members. That being said, Jesse is inspirational and has taught me a lot during our two week project. I am a lucky person to be placed on his team. Thanks for everything, Jesse!"
#### Sonia
Working with Jesse was truly a pleasure. He was an excellent project manager, and his attention to detail helped us to build a truly beautiful final product. Of all the people I have worked with at Turing, I would say Jesse is the most well-rounded in his skill set. He has fantastic styling skills but is also incredibly talented when it comes to back-end functionality. One suggestion I would make for Jesse is to slow down a bit when he is discussing code with his partner. There were times when he would question my code and it felt a bit like he was simply doubting my abilities rather than actually trying to improve the code. I have no doubt that this is unintentional, but it can be frustrating to be peppered with questions when in the process of working out a solution. Jesse would benefit from trusting that other people on his team are also capable of completing the tasks allocated to them. This may lower his overall stress level as he may feel less weight on his shoulders. Overall I really enjoyed working with Jesse and I look forward to working with him again in the future!
#### David
Jesse is a natural leader. In fact, working with Jesse was the first time at Turing that I learned what a team leader on a group project should look like. This project was Jesse's baby and we were all raising it together. Jesse took the reigns of this project from the first day, and never let go. In all of his interactions with the group, he would always act professionally and was never sour to anyone, or made anyone feel like they were less than him. He has a strict, determined tone of voice when someone else is driving that always brought us back on track when a distraction arose. Jesse would always strive to improve the project in a myriad of small ways, all on his time. Particularly during the end, we encountered a bug in the code that broke our "Logout" button. It was late, and we had to have the project ready. Instead of giving up and reverting to a past working commit, Jesse pushed through with the team and fixed the bug. There were many other instances where Jesse would go home after 7-8pm when we were stuck on a problem, and then post the solution to slack at 10pm. I could tell that he has a strong passion for this kind of work, and I'll never forget this experience. Thank you Jesse for being an amazing partner, I know you will continue to enlighten every team you work with.
