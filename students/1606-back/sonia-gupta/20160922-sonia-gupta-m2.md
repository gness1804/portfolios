# Sonia Gupta - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Last module involved some personal issues that required me to repeat Mod 2. My experience at Turing has involved a lot of falling down, crumbling, and then getting back up again. This round was no different. I set out to cement the knowledge I had gleaned last time and I believe I have accomplished that. Even more important, however, is that I set out to build my own resilience and to develop the internal fortitude necessary to soldier on in the face of frequent setbacks. I have been a quitter before, but I vowed that I would not let myself down this time. I can confidently say that I kept that vow, and I intend never to break it again.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We worked on a number of tutorials this module which gradually tested and increased our knowledge of web applications. We began with Sinatra and finally graduated to Rails. Both frameworks helped to cement our understanding of CRUD functionality.

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/robot_world2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown)

Robot World involved creating a Sinatra app from scratch. It involved full CRUD functionality as well as some model functionality.

---

### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

I completed Blogger the first time I did Module 2, but did not complete it this time around. The project introduced us to Rails and reinforced the MVC concepts while providing practice on database migrations and workflow.

---

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/mix_master2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master taught us how to deploy an app to Heroku and how to model different kinds of data relationships. We also learned how to create partials and how to fabricate objects for testing.

---

### Rails Mini Project - IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

The Rails Mini Project brought all of the Rails concepts together. We created more complex relationships, performed migrations, and implemented CRUD functionality.

---

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two team projects this module, one which focused on data associations and relationships in Sinatra (Rush Hour) and another which focused on building a web-app with full CRUD functionality in Rails (Little Shop).

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour mimicked a traffic analysis tool and taught us about the HTTP request-response cycle while developing our understanding of complex data associations.

From Jasmin Hudacsek: Sonia was an absolute pleasure to work with on Rush Hour. Even though she had worked on the project before, she didn’t let her prior experience steal her other teammates’ learning experience at all. She was very communicative and clearly expressed when she was happy or concerned about our progress. While she sometimes doubts her own skills and internalizes these sentiments to her depriment, her working through this while working on Rush Hour also helped me realize that I am sometimes blind to my communication style and how it could also be improved. I would be lucky to have her as a partner again moving on to Module 3 and 4. Plus, she still keeps those fridges sparkling clean, and EVERYONE continues to benefit from her rockstar-ness.

From Chase Dunagan: Sonia was a terrific partner on Rush Hour.  Our group clicked well from the start, and I think that’s in large part to Sonia’s special ability to be so considerate to the people she works with.  Her coding ability is much much better than she gives herself credit for, and her ideas are unique and fruitful. I enjoyed working with Sonia very much, and I hope to work with her again in the future.  If I had one critique, it would be that Sonia believed in her abilities more.  She's extremely smart, and that shows anytime you talk to her.  Without her great ideas, our Rush Hour project would have been very different, and I am extremely thankful for them.  Sonia is awesome, and it’s hard to put into words how happy I am that she is in our cohort, now.

### Little Shop of Orders - The Waddams Emporium

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop taught us how to build out a web application with full CRUD functionality and complex data associations, user authentication, and authorization. We also developed our styling skills and pushed the application up to Heroku.

From Susi Irwin: Sonia's passion and commitment to our project, to learning, and to her classmates is incredible. Her collaboration skills are inspiring and working with her in both a group and a pair setting has been such a great experience. She has no fear with just getting her hands into the code and trying something out. Sonia taught me that sometimes the best way to think through a complicated problem is just write some code and see what happens! She is an code-experimenter and it is awesome! If I could offer Sonia one point to work on it would be to work on articulating herself when her frustration starts to kick in. There was one moment during Little Shop where a hidden application file would not show up on her computer and she was getting a bit stressed out about it. I would urge her to not be so hard on herself when things get a little off track. Sonia is so talented and I am just thrilled that I finally got to work alongside her!

From Jesse Spevack:
###### Strengths
Sonia's strengths are wide ranging, impressive, and contributed significantly to my own learning and the completion of our Little Shop project. A few that stood out in particular for me are:
* Verbal communication evidenced by clear explanation of thought during pairing sessions and team stand-ups.
* Written communication evidenced by her note taking, which the entire team referenced throughout the project, as well as her issue reporting, commit messages, responses to other team member's commit messages, and Slack.
* Analytical thought / logical reasoning, evidenced by her linguistic precision and bug squashing.
* Humor, which makes pairing with her a pleasure.
* Asking questions to find answers, evidenced by her deft use of Google search and Stack overflow.
Also on the technical side, Sonia was directly responsible for implementing a number of challenging features on our project including cart creation order placement. The team also relied on her Heroku technical knowledge.

###### Area of growth
In terms of an area of growth, I would like to see Sonia apologize less - out of all the times I heard her apologize when working with her, I don't think I can think of a single instance that she did anything wrong or worth apologizing over. Part of that might come from not having confidence in her technical skill set, which is considerable.

From David Davydov: I once told Sonia that she was a cyborg, and I still think this may partly be true. What impressed me about Sonia more than anything was her ability to hold massive amounts of information in her head, make sense of it all, and when she didn't know something she would know the right place to reference it. She is an organizational master. Often during our project, I would know that we'd need to use a technique we learned in a random lesson some odd days ago. Whenever I would ask her where I could reference this technique, she wouldn't hesitate before responding with the right answer. My pairing experience with Sonia was always positive. There was a moment during the project that the approach we were taking was getting complicated and I suggested that we slow down and try another way. My delivery is something I could work on, and when what I said came off as off-putting, Sonia let me know and I appreciated it. I reminded Sonia that I always recognized her super-human commitment and dedication to the team. I would be excited to work with and learn more from Sonia in the future, she is a strong resource to any group she works with.

## D: Professional Skills

This module's focus on professional skills was very useful. It helped me to refocus my drive and the purpose of my time at Turing.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

I really appreciated this Gear Up's emphasis on the journey involved in getting better at something. It can be easy to lose sight of that when I'm fixated on the end result. There is no end result without all of the work in between. For me this has consisted in doing the smallest possible thing and then doing the next smallest thing. Much like coding!

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I was absent on the date of this Gear Up due to illness.

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This Gear Up seemed to stir up strong emotions in the Turing Community. I realized that there are a lot of people who become incredibly defensive when confronted with their inability to face their own prejudices. The film and the ensuing fallout reinvigorated my drive to better understand what motivates humans to respect and care about each other in mutually beneficial ways.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fs65d1N8eT2yoPHQE74NUM-UdLs1PxMSfovryHL6xJM/edit?usp=sharing)

I learned the importance of simply reaching out, not with the goal of gaining employment, but with the goal of learning about people in this industry and how they do what they do.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
  * In both projects we used Waffle extensively and it was a fantastic tool for keeping us on track. Unfortunately, there were times when ideas were vaguely discussed but no cards were made for them, and those ideas would either not be completed or someone would simply take it upon themselves to implement functionality without discussing it with the rest of the group or giving others the opportunity to contribute.


2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
  * I learned to simply voice my opinions and have more faith in my ability to contribute to projects. I was less afraid to dive in and offer suggestions than I have been in the past, and this is due to receiving feedback about having more confidence in my abilities.

#### Networking with Lia

I learned the importance of branding myself properly. I find the prospect of selling myself to be very intimidating, but Lia framed the process in an engaging way that allowed me to feel more confident about it.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Jasmin Hudacsek: Jasmin was such a pleasure to work with. Rush Hour moved like clockwork due to her excellent project management skills. Our group was cohesive and collaborative, and she really helped keep us on track. She has a depth of knowledge and understanding that is truly impressive, and I learned a lot from her. On a personal level, Jasmin has proven herself to be kind, empathetic, and mature beyond her years. She has considerable emotional intelligence and approaches problems calmly and with reassurance for all involved. I hope I get the opportunity to work with her again, and I’m really glad to know her.

To Susi Irwin: Susi was such an incredibly supportive team mate. Her optimism and drive made it an absolute blast to work with her. She was willing to push through the difficult parts of the project while maintaining composure. I was most impressed with Susi’s supportive attitude when pairing. I have often been second-guessed and limited by partners who don’t trust that I am capable of coding. Susi never made me feel that way. She was open and willing to try things with me, and was patient even when I failed. I also learned a good bit of CSS from her and look forward to learning more! One thing Susi might work on is decompressing a bit when tricky bugs pop up. We had a moment on the last day of the project where our logout functionality was not working. Susi seemed to be quite distressed, but she pushed through and helped us to find a solution. I would encourage Susi to remember that she is absolutely capable of moving through these difficulties the next time a bug pops up so that she can retain her optimism even during the rough patches. I think we could both probably stand to remember that about ourselves!

To David Davydov: I was really lucky to have the chance to work with David during Little Shop. He often spots issues that others miss, and he is very insightful. He has a generally calm demeanor which is particularly helpful when coding gets stressful. I particularly appreciate David’s receptiveness to feedback. There was a moment during our project where I felt that I David was questioning me in a way that implied I did not know what I was doing. I brought it up with him and he was incredibly receptive. He did not get defensive, and he went to Starbucks and brought me back a croissant. I really appreciated that, and it made me respect him even more. Ultimately, I had a really great experience pairing with David. I think he just got better and better as a team mate during our project, and I hope I get to work with him again.

To Jesse Spevack: Working with Jesse was truly a pleasure. He was an excellent project manager, and his attention to detail helped us to build a truly beautiful final product. Of all the people I have worked with at Turing, I would say Jesse is the most well-rounded in his skill set. He has fantastic styling skills but is also incredibly talented when it comes to back-end functionality. One suggestion I would make for Jesse is to slow down a bit when he is discussing code with his partner. There were times when he would question my code and it felt a bit like he was simply doubting my abilities rather than actually trying to improve the code. I have no doubt that this is unintentional, but it can be frustrating to be peppered with questions when in the process of working out a solution. Jesse would benefit from trusting that other people on his team are also capable of completing the tasks allocated to them. This may lower his overall stress level as he may feel less weight on his shoulders. Overall I really enjoyed working with Jesse and I look forward to working with him again in the future!

To Chase Dunagan: Chase is such a huge asset to the Turing community. When the basement seems dark and foreboding, and the code seems overwhelming, Chase steps in and offers incredible perspective, optimism, and insight. I think our Rush Hour team actually really enjoyed the work, and that is largely due to Chase’s influence. When you take an amazingly bright personality and thoughtful nature and mix it with dedication and hard work, you’ve got a recipe for a fantastic programmer. That, right there, is Chase.

To Jean Joeris: Jean has been an incredibly positive influence on our cohort and on Armstrong Posse. He is a natural leader, and has been a gentle guide in our learning in both the posse and the classroom. I have appreciated his willingness to answer our questions and to offer his insights when appropriate. He has also fostered an environment of tolerance and kindness at Turing. He is an asset to the community and we are lucky to have him.

To Bryan Goss: I have seen Bryan grow so much as a person over the course of this module. I am incredibly impressed by his self-awareness and his willingness to change. Although he has had some interpersonal conflicts during the last six weeks, he has truly made an effort to learn from those incidents. He has improved his communication style considerably, and has softened his interactions with other people. I believe this has resulted in improved communication, and I am always glad to have a chance to chat with him. He is an incredibly pleasant, intelligent, and insightful person. He is also very kind, and has offered a helping hand and kind words to me on more than one occasion. I'm really glad to know him, and am glad to have the opportunity to continue my learning with him.

To Ben Pepper: Ben has been such an inspiration this module. He has helped me to overcome my own self-doubt and has taught me the value of self-reflection and community involvement. He paired with mod 1 students more than any other person in my cohort, and his willingness to lend a hand is truly remarkable. Turing is lucky to have him, and I am lucky to be his friend.

To Raphael Barbo: Raphael is an incredibly solid person. He has compassion, wit, and tremendous insight into human nature. He has often shown me kindness during hard times. His willingness to push through regardless of the difficulty he may be facing is a testament to his resilience. He is an example for other students, and I'm glad to have the opportunity to learn with him.

### Being a Community Member

From Ben Pepper: Sonia has been one of biggest driving forces of my ability to stay at Turing through a lot of hard times. No matter what is going on She is always willing to go for a walk and take time out of her day to help me figure things out. Talking with her has, more often than not, led to some breakthrough I would not have come to on my own. Her ability to understand any problem and persist until she fully understands it is inspiring and something I hope to emulate. She is an enormous asset to Turing and I am luck to know her and to be able to call her my friend.

From Raphael Barbo: Sonia was a true inspiration this module, I have seen her dedicate some much time to get to the level of knowledge and expertise that she is in now, and it goes to show that hard-work, dedication, and willingness to learn can take you really far in life. She is a sweet caring person, and I am glad she decided to rejoin in the 1606 cohort. Raphael Barbo

### Playing a Part

I definitely think I could have participated more in the community this module, but I instead focused on developing confidence in my skills because everything has taken me so much longer to absorb than it has for most of my peers. I did pair with Module 1 students on a few occasions and also continued with the fridge purge on Fridays.
