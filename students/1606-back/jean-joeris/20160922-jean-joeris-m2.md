# Jean Joeris - M2 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to learn how to use CSS and HTML to create not ugly websites. I want to learn how to use Rails and Sinatra to build the backend to the websites. I want to use the knowledge of the HTTP cycyle that I learned at my internship to learn even more.

My git workflow on the Black Thursday project last mod was subpar, and I would like to fix that this mod.

I also want to become a leader in Armstrong posse, and make good progress towards learning machine learning. At the very least I would like to gain some level of comfort with the TensorFlow library. This means I will need to learn some Python this module as well.

I also want to become the leader of LGBTuring over the course of the mod, as Nick will be graduating at the end of the mod

#### Refection at end of mod

I believe I met the goals I set out for myself. I greatly improved my HTML & CSS skills, feel comfortable with Rails, Sinatra and basic MVC. I was able to apply my previous internship experience with the HTTP cycle to better internalize my understanding.

I think my git workflow is much better. As a group we had almost 400 commits on our little shop and made excellent use of waffle. I believe my git workflow score on little shop will reflect this.

Armstrong posse was a big success, though we ended up not investigating TensorFlow as much. Instead, we have been focusing on getting everyone to understand the basics of regression, which is used in all machine learning. I have improved my python skills some though not as much as I would like. I was not able to succeed significantly in applying these skills to little shop, which was disappointing.

LGBTuring will be lead by me next mod, and I received positive feedback about the sushi dinner we held.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

These were individual projects. They consisted of independent projects (robot world, basement animals), tutorials (blogger, mix master) and communication (blog post, lightning talk). They were not evaluated, so scores are not present.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown)

This was a website building basic CRUD functionality using robots as an example. I also used it as an opportunity to practice my styling skills.

#### Blogger

#### Rails Miniproject - Basement Animals

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rails_mini_project)

This was a mini project built over a weekend. It started as jokes after a sign declaring there 'were _not_ scorpions in the bathrooms' was found on the inside of the bathroom. I ended up as an experiment in nokogiri and regex to get taxonomical data from wikipedia. I learned a lot from this project, including an amusing reminder of just how much I shouldn't trust users.

#### Lighting Talk

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

Ben Pepper -

  Jean was a fantastic Project Manager. He was always willing to listen to our ideas (even if they didn’t always pan out). His patience with me made me mire willing to think about a problem and try to help find a solution. Jean always made sure that we were all working on the project and if someone looked to be disengaged he would ask what our thoughts were. I got stuck on one test issue and instead of telling me what to write, Jean just kept asking questions that lead me to the answer I needed. That was huge for me since it meant that I could better understand what had happened have a better understanding of the process The biggest thing I would suggest is to not lose the ability to include everyone in the group. It made a stressful project much easier since I knew that even if my idea was wrong I would not be belittled for it. That was the best part of the group.

Matt DeMarteau -

  Jean and I worked together in a three-person group, on our first group project in Module 2, called Rush Hour. He took the the role as project manager and proved to be an outstanding leader.  From the very beginning of the project, I took note of Jean’s ability to stay receptive to others feedback and ideas.  When a team member was stressed or quite, Jean would notice right away and ask if they needed to switch roles or if they needed a quick break.  He valued each person’s input and treated each member equally when delegating responsibility for the project.  I have great respect for Jean in his ability to lead a team and really appreciated him asking at the end of the project how he could have done better.  I didn’t have much feedback to give him because I thought the communication and delegation of tasks was handled very professionally.  I know that Jean has the ability to lead teams through tough waters in the future, but this project seemed to come together in all ways.

#### Little Shop of Orders - Good Grocers

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j-sm-n/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop of Orders was the final mod 2 project. The goal was to take all of our knowledge gained over the module and build an e-commerce site from scratch using Ruby on Rails. We decided to build a grocery store called Good Grocers. This has been a very productive project for our group. It has solidified a lot of my understanding of rails and MVC. Additionally, I have reflected throughout on how much I have learned in 6 short weeks.

(This portfolio was due before the project was assessed)

Jasmin Hudacsek -
  During Little Shop, Jean was invaluable asset as a group partner and was very good about helping us stay on topic and on schedule. Even though our whole cohort knows his coding skills and algorithmic knowledge are beyond impressive, he never lets it go to his head and is extremely easy to approach with any question. Outside of Little Shop, I very much enjoyed getting to know Jean even more and continue to be amazed at how awesome of a person he is in general. He’s shown awesome leadership with Armstrong and LGBTuring and I am excited to see what he can accomplish while he’s at Turing and beyond.

Raphael Barbo -
  I paired with Jean during our Little Shop Project (also know as GoodGrocers). His algorithmic thinking abilities are
  beyond admiration. I feel that Jean has a lot teacher's like skills and I have appreciated very much all the time he has put into explaining concepts and approaches that at times were not clear to me. At this moment, the only constructive feedback I can think about for Jean, is to sometimes listen more to your peers (mainly on the sense of ideas). I know having such an amazing approach to problems, and a very logical mind, make him see things from a very unique perspective. With such brilliance I believe he could turn average ideas into big awesome outcomes. It was honestly a great pleasure working with Jean and I have a lot of admiration and respect for his skills and everything he has taught me throughout the project.

## D: Professional Skills

These are reflections and deliverables for sessions held to build professional and soft skills.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

### Reflection on Gear Up

  I have done social justice workshops similar to Gear Up for several years. I believe in the importance of this work, and the social justice mission is part of what attracted me to Turing. I understand that it is painful work at times. Even if one cares enough to engage, it is difficult to learn how to separate acknowledging privilege from attacking one's character. Facilitating these conversations has pissed off friends, even friends who cared enough to want to have these conversations. When I stopped doing this work, a contributing factor was the energy it took.

  Attending Gear Up has been mixed because of this previous experience. I enjoy discussions that are difficult, nuanced and personal. However, the difficulties we have seen at Turing around Gear Up are eerily familiar for me. I have tried to address this some, including helping facilitate one of the small discussion groups last Friday after CODE. Knowing how much energy these conversations can take, I have contributed less than I have in the past. This is not out of a lack of caring but setting my own boundaries to ensure my success at Turing.
  My previous experience makes me want to take a major leadership role in planning Gear Up. The time Turing takes and the health of my wife means that I cannot. I have felt very conflicted about this at times.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* List of 10 companies with one person you could connect with at each
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/JeanJoeris/4b824d24e384e44f659f7d2ed8fbdb69)

It was very nice to have discussion about how to make connections. Directing us to try and find people we might want to work for in a concrete way was useful for me. I haven't followed up with as many of them as I would like, but I am much further along that I would have been without this workshop

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
  * I tried to be extremely conscious about how I communicate with team members. In particular, I wanted to try and be empathetic and specific in feedback. From both groups I got feedback that this was really appreciated. It made them feel listened to and they were more willing to engage because of this. I did not receive feedback that suggested to me that any particular strategy I used did not work. I try to remember this doesn't mean they were all successful, just that I haven't gotten data to tell me they were unsuccessful.


2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process?
  * One piece of feedback I have gotten is that when I get excited I can lose some of my mindful communication. I have responded to this by trying to seek feedback from others more often, and my telling people that I might do this. It is not their responsibility to police my behavior, but by telling them I hope to make it easier for them if they chose to call me out. It is always important remember that valuing mindful communication does not translate into 100% application of this value.

#### Networking with Lia

* This was an extremely helpful class! As an introvert, it was so useful to have somebody a) explicitly acknowledge the difficulty I face in networking and b) give me concrete ways to overcome this difficulty. I was able to turn around and apply this at the Denver Startup Week job fair. Thanks to Lia I was able to make multiple connections.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Ben Pepper (rush hour) -

Ben was a great team member. He has great perseverance and doesn’t fear asking questions when things aren’t totally clear. He has a very professional work manner, and always delivers things on time. Even when he needed to do something else it never affected his deliverables. On a personal level, Ben was very friendly and low stress throughout. The one area of improvement that stood out to me is being more careful about pushing to master. It wasn’t a common thing, and a little more mindfulness would probably go very far.

Matt DeMarteau (rush hour) -

I really enjoyed working with Matt. He was very friendly and hard working. I really appreciated his willingness to not go on autopilot and question our design decisions. I believe the whole team was improved by this, as our choices became more mindful. There was no distance between him and the rest of the group, which was impressive given that he was new to our cohort. He  had a happy attitude the entire project, which was nice. I hope Matt continues to keep his cool level head, as it is a boon to any groups he is on

Jasmin Hudacsek (little shop) -

My experience with Jasmin was excellent. She was a very capable project manager. She consistently kept us on track, by organizing the waffle board. I was impressed with her ability to put herself in the user's shoes. Many times throughout the project she directed us away from solutions that serve us as developers towards solutions that serve the user. Despite her prior experience as a project manager, she never became overbearing. She was defend her opinions, but never try to user her knowledge as a trump card. She was also very friendly and relaxed throughout. I learned a great deal about management by watching her, and am glad we were in the same group

Raphael Barbo (little shop) -

Raphael has been an awesome team member. He is always willing keep working. His work experience prior to turing shines through in his excellent work ethic and positive attitude. He even volunteered to give me a ride to and from Turing one weekend. He is a very capable coder, but doesn't let that stop him from asking for help. He has no ego about seeking help when necessary. His willingness to keep working was a huge boon to the team, as he helped make sure cards were getting done. He was always happy to take on whatever task was needed. A few times it seemed to me he was so focused to move the project forward that he didn't voice his concerns as clearly as he could have. This is not to imply he doesn't communicate well, the vast majority of the time he was voiced himself clearly. Raphael is extremely kind and was a joy to work with.

Noah Berman (1608 BE) regarding his participation in the hackthe.news hackathon -

Noah has a great drive to learn that will serve him well in programming. Despite being a mod 1 student with little coding experience prior to Turing, he came to the hackathon. This alone demonstrates that he wants to learn and isn’t afraid of jumping into something new. In the high pressure environment of a 2 hr hackathon he kept his cool. When we reached a point where he didn’t know enough rails to be helpful he pivoted into helping us using his other skills. His experience with journalism was invaluable during the hackathon, as it allowed him to quickly made design decisions to move the group forward. Noah is an excellent team member and I would love to work with him again.

### Being a community member

Feedback for people who I worked with is listed under the appropriate project

Daniel Shin (1608 BE) Regarding my role as Armstrong Posse lead -

Jean has done an excellent job at organizing the Armstrong posse. He has been able to consistently and thoroughly explain the complex concepts that surround machine learning. This has made the Armstrong posse very welcoming, despite the potentially intimidating topics that naturally come out of such subjects. For future meetings, it may help notify to other members what kind of discussion will occur during the session (e.g. we might briefly touch on calculus) so members know what to expect.

Sonia Gupta -

Jean has been an incredibly positive influence on our cohort and on Armstrong Posse. He is a natural leader, and has been a gentle guide in our learning in both the posse and the classroom. I have appreciated his willingness to answer our questions and to offer his insights when appropriate. He has also fostered an environment of tolerance and kindness at Turing. He is an asset to the community and we are lucky to have him.

### Playing a Part

This module I have tried very hard to contribute to the Turing community.

#### Armstrong Posse Lead
On essentially the first day of the mod I became the lead of Armstrong posse. I took on this role because I am interested in the topics Armstrong covers, Erin Greenhalgh (1603 4 BE) was graduating soon and needed to pass off this role, and because I wanted to embody the changes I wanted Armstrong to make compared to last mod. Everyone in Armstrong agreed we didn't do much last mod, so I wanted to be part of the solution to this. I haven't gone alone in this task, as Erin and Bryan Goss have been extremely helpful in organizing the posse. I also arranged to get Aaron Greenspan to come in and give lunch talks on machine learning and regression analysis. As part of Armstrong posse I also organized two Friday spike sessions.


#### LGBTuring Co-Lead
I have also been co-leading LGBTuring with Nick Pisciotta. With Nick soon to be graduating, I am taking on the responsiblity of leading this important group. The membership numbers are not large, but I believe holding safe space for LGBTQ individuals is very important and I wanted to make sure it continued.

#### Other
I participated in the hackthe.news hackathon with other Turing students. While this was not contributing as directly to the Turing community, by helping us get 3rd place I did my part to grow Turing's name and reputation within the tech community. The fact that multiple people said we had the most finished product at the hackathon shows we were building Turing's reputation for technical excellence. I enjoyed working with students from other mods. It was really cool to see a mod 1 front end student make a website much prettier than mine. It was an enjoyable challenge to be under a time crunch and trying to to explain things and engage a mod 1 backend student.

I helped with Try Turing in Fort Collins. The QA panel at the beginning gave me interesting perspective. I saw prospective students who came to Turing for reasons similar to my own, and was able to share candidly about my excellent experience here. I attended on the front-end day but was apply my programming skills to help them. It was fun to learn out jQuery and help others debug it at the same time.
