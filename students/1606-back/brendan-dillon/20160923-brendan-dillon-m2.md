# Brendan Dillon - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I really hope to become comfortable with as many tools as possible. Right now, the idea of picking up something just by reading its documentation seems really intimidating and overwhelming to me. By the end of the module, though, I am hoping that I can develop the skill of learning a thing quickly with minimal instruction. In addition, I plan to improve on my communication skills and group workflow.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The work in this module shifted pretty heavily from practicing logic to figuring out how to get a ton of new technolgies to work. A lot of these projects felt unsuccessful at first, but I found myself able to implement things that I had worked on in them much more easily on later projects.

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown)

In this project, I created a simple CRUD app using Sinatra and SQLite3. I got stuck for a few days on one particularly dumb problem, but in trying to figure out what was wrong with my app I developed a much deeper understanding of how MVC and CRUD work.

---

### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

In this tutorial, I created a blog that associates posts with comments and tags. This was my first time using ActiveRecord, and the tutorial helped me understand how that worked.

---

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

In this tutorial, I used test-driven development with Capybara and FactoryGirl to create an app that allows users to create playlists out of a selection of songs in a database. The biggest takeaway from this was how to use feature tests to drive app development.

---

### Rails Mini Project - Recipe Faceoff

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/recipe-faceoff)

In this project, I used feature test-driven development, authentication, and authorization to create an app that allowed users to create recipes from a list of ingredients that were provided by an admin. I intended to implement a feature that allowed users to vote on the best recipes, but I was unable to complete this. It was my first experience trying to build something that I had come up with, and I realized pretty quickly the difficulty of figuring out the next step when it is not given to you.

---

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The two team projects this time were tricky from the perspective of establishing a good workflow for comparatively large projects with comparitively large teams. Figuring out the next step was often tricky, as was splitting up the work without stepping on other people's pieces.

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/rush_hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

In this project, I worked with Raphael Barbo and Dan Broadbent to create an app that handled JSON data and sorted it into a database with ActiveRecord. This project really forced us to understand why good schema design is useful and how to make use of associations.

Raphael Barbo: I worked with Brendan during our Rush Hour project. The value I took out of pairing with him goes beyond what I could possibly put into words. His dedication, approach to problems, and his skills in breaking down big problems into small seemly easy to solve puzzles. I would very much enjoy working with him again, and I feel that he is gonna accomplish real big things once he graduates turing. As far as constructive feedback, I would tell Brendan to just try to "dummy down" some big concepts that he seemed to have a really good grasp on, and explain a bit more into details, but I would not say that it is at all times negative, but rather me trying to explore his knowledge and know-how.

Dan Broadbent: I really enjoyed working with you on the Rush Hour project.  I felt you did a great job as project manager.  You allowed everyone to make their point about the direction the project should go, and made the best decision even when it wasn’t your own.  Your knowledge of what was going on in the project as a whole was impressive and allowed us to really make big breakthroughs quickly as a group.  The whole group had really great communication and we were able to address issues as the came up and keep things moving smoothly.  You were a great asset to the team and I hope I get to work with you again.

### Little Shop of Orders - Turing Antiques

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

In this project, I worked with Nate Anderson, Calaway, and Ben Pepper to design a shopping cart app using Rails. While we had previously learned pretty much every piece of this, it was my first chance to make everything from databases to authorization to session carts work together. It was also our first experience with making controllers and models that were not associated with database objects, but still followed RESTful conventions.

Nate Anderson: Brendan was a great partner in Little Shop. He always had many ideas to push along our progress in the project.  The creativity he showed when solving problems was always impressive and his work ethic is second to none. Also, his help in the styling was huge to the group as a whole as us back enders struggled to push ourselves past this portion of the project.
The only thing I would recommend is to speak up a little more often. His ideas were always valued but I felt like at times he would hold back a bit. But other than that, he was a fantastic partner and I would be happy to work with him again.

Calaway: Brendan has been an amazing asset to our Little Shop team. His grasp of the material and ability to quickly learn and internalize new concepts is second to none. His communication is concise and clear, and while he doesn't always make his thoughts known as frequently as others might, he knows when it's important to contribute ideas and they are always well received when he offers them. I feel like I've already learned a lot by pairing with him and would certainly enjoy working on any other project together in the future.

Ben Pepper: Brendan was an invaluable member of our Little Shop group. His grasp of the topics, issues and, tasks was exemplary.Brendan’s ability to explain the task at hand and help me through a few difficult issues was extremely helpful. He communicates effortlessly when in a group and can succinctly express what he is thinking. Whenever I was stuck on something I could turn to him and ask. He would take a second to think through what was happening and then explain exactly what was happening. He patiently explained how to fix merge conflicts at least twice to me which was wonderful to dispel some git problems for me.

## D: Professional Skills

The professional skills focus in this module seemed to shift a little more from "working on a team" to "getting hired". I am fairly comfortable with the former, but the latter terrifies me. Still, I feel more prepared to start thinking about jobs than I was six months ago.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This session was a good reminder that I need to practice avoiding using my mental capacity and energy up on things outside of my learning.

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This session reinforced the importance of good communication and a good definition of expectations at a team's outset.

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This session really highlighted the problems that women have to deal with in this field. I am sometimes more blind than I should be to some of these problems, and it is important that I stay cognisant about fighting for an inclusive and welcoming environment.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

It is more important to grow your network and put yourself in communication with people who are hiring than it is to look for posted jobs.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
One thing that we struggled with in Rush Hour was a tendency to get something done and call it good without refactoring. We did not have a team member who acted as the stickler on that, and none of us stepped up to that irritating plate. However, we did do a really good job of switching roles frequently enough that we were able to be productive as three people working together. (tri-ing?)
2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
My team members recommended that I slow down to explain myself a little more clearly, as I sometimes take logical leaps. I have been making more of an effort, since then, to articulate my thought process.

#### Networking with Lia

My biggest takeaway from this session is that, while you should have an elevator pitch for yourself, that you can keep networking conversation engaging by focusing on what people seem to be excited about.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Raphael Barbo: I worked with Raphael on our Rush Hour project. The biggest thing that stood out to me about Raphael was his energy and dedication to getting things done. We wound up working pretty long days on Rush Hour, not just because Raphael would want to keep going, but because he would be enthusiastic about continuing and that carried throughout the group. He is also a really strong programmer who would come up with some great ideas. However, he sometimes underestimated himself and was not very confident about conveying what he was thinking about. While his communication in general was really strong, he did sometimes struggle to communicate his ideas, and I think that being more sure of them would help.

Dan Broadbent: I worked with Dan on our Rush Hour project. Dan's ability to think through a problem in a step-by-step manner and not leave logical holes was really impressive. Raphael and I both tended to come to ideas from out of left field, but Dan was really skilled at asking the right questions for those ideas to actually work. Dan is also a certified black belt in Google-fu, and constantly was figuring out better ways to implement things. The biggest piece of feedback I have for Dan is that he work on his typing and atom workflow, as things tended to slow down a bit whenever he drove. Other than that, Dan is a really strong programmer and a great person to have on your team.

Nate Anderson: I worked with Nate on our Little Shop project. Nate is skilled at being able to solve problems with really clean, efficient code. It is very apparent when working with Nate or looking at code that he has written that he puts a lot of thought into the design and structure of the code. He also is great at putting his head down and getting a lot done in a short amount of time. The only thing for Nate to work on is figuring out what questions to ask when somebody else is going through their work.

Ben Pepper: I worked with Ben on our Little Shop project. Ben is fantastic about pushing through and getting a lot of stuff done. He clearly understands how he works best, and was able to move waffle cards more quickly than a blackjack dealer. He also has the skill of asking the right questions when going through somebody else's code so that everyone in the group is able to understand it well. It is very apparent, though, when Ben gets frusturated with something, and that sort of very visible frusturation tended to infect the rest of the group. Still, Ben is a great person to work with and has a better work ethic than he gives himself credit for.

Calaway: I worked with Calaway on our Little Shop project. Calaway has a really good sense for what a quality project should look like and keeping the group to a vision. Calaway acted as project manager on Little Shop, and did a fantastic job at keeping our goals straight and agile. While the rest of us struggled to get into the flow of communicating via GitHub, Calaway held us to it until we kept to it as a group. Even outside of his project manager role, though, Calaway was really thoughtful about the design of the project and keeping our code clean.
