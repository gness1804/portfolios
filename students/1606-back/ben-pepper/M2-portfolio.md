### Areas of Emphasis

This module for me is intended to be more about focusing on what is happening then trying to keep my feet under me. I don't want to get to a point where I am panicked about the work load or the info. So if that means taking more time with the material thats what has to happen. If I get 3's on everything thats fine. I just want to ensure that I understand what is going on with all the frameworks we will be working with.

### End of Module Assessment

2: Developer can execute an algorithm or plan when steps are provided

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring

3. Rails Syntax & API

2: Developer is generally able to utilize Rails, but shows confusion or shallow knowledge about what Rails provides

4. MVC & Rails Style

3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing

2: Developer struggles to use tests to drive development

6. Collaboration

### Work

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

* [Robot World](https://github.com/bfpepper/Robot-World)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown)

Robot World was a project we had to design a Sinatra web app from scratch by tying in robot pictures to each profile. This project was a bit difficult for me as I struggled to understand setting routes and actions within Sinatra.

* [Mix Master](https://github.com/bfpepper/Mix-Master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master had us design a Rials project for adding songs and artists to a given playlist and then tie in the Spotify API. We had to create our own routes and views which gave me a better understanding of how Rails functions.

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/bfpepper/idea-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Idea box was a quick Rails 5 mini project that was designed to give us a crash course in Rails CRUD before starting Little Shop.  I wanted to focus more on Authorization and Authentication in this project and that is where I spent my time. I knew that I would be getting more experience with routes, view, partials, etc, so I wanted to make sure I understood the security side of Rails better.

* [Blogger](https://github.com/bfpepper/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

Blogger was designed as a simple tutorial for how to build a blog site and to learn the basics of what Rails can accomplish. This was one of the first attempts into working with Rials and it showed me a lot of what can be done with minimal inout from the developer.

## Team

### Projects

Our team projects gave us time to not only dive deeper into Sinatra and Rails but also to to work more in teams to simulate the real world. These were both valuable projects to learn more about how Sinatra doesn't have al the "magic" of Rails but also how Sinatra is far more lightweight and customizable than Rails.

#### (Project Name)

* [Rush Hour](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush hour was designed to be a web traffic information parser. The idea was to take in raw JSON from a client and then parse it and display it in a meaningful way. This way the client could understand what info users were accessing and how their servers were functioning.

###Scores and comments
#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view
(feedback to me)

* [Little Shop](https://github.com/bfpepper/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little shop was our first real Rails project. It required us to build an e-commerce site.  This included having authenticated users, admins, carts, etc. This was my first project at Turing where I felt I could sink my teeth into the material. This was were everything came together and it was something I could show to people. I loved doing the OAuth as an extension and was beyond excited when it worked on Heroku. This has been my most favorite project because it also tied in user stories and it made it more appealing to deal with those as opposed to iterations.

###Professional Skills

Turing took more steps this module to emphasize not only professional development but also personal development. This was something that I fought at first but have started to pay more attention to. It is important to not only know how to code but also to be able to connect with a variety of people. This is what Friday Gear Ups are about to me.

####Gear up

#####Getting Better At Difficult Things

This is a difficult task for me and it was reassuring to hear from both Kathy Sierra and Ta-Nehisi Coates about their struggles as well. Dealing with difficult tasks is something that I still need to work on but this Gear Up was helpful in starting me on the right path.

#####There Is An I In Team

Dr. Brene Brown's video is what hit home the most for me during this Gear Up.  There are certain aspects of my life that I have boundaries and things are generally better when I have them. Its the hardest thing for me to set boundaries with people but it has been something that I have tried to improve over the years. It was interesting to hear her talk about how people can be more loving if there are boundaries and gave me more reason to continue down that path. Being honest and up front with people is something I had to learn while working for Tesla. It my owners could not trust what I was saying and that I had the best intentions then any hard conversation we had was going to be more difficult.

#####CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

This was probably my most favorite Gear Up of Mod 2. The video was incredibly interesting and, well presented. I was glad that I was here to see just how pervasive the gender gap is in technology. It gave me a new perspective that I did not think I would ever see. However, the more interesting part of the Gear Up for me was the discussion. Our group was the group that wanted to discuss why this was even a discussion to have in Turing. As it turned out the group that was there were all people who wanted to hear the other side of the equation (why, in fact, this wasn't important to discuss). Since we all agreed that this was an issue the conversation turned more to how to help Turing become a truly inclusive community. We talked about some of the challenges and problems that we saw as inhibiting this and tried to find ways to improve it.

##Professional Development Workshops

####Finding Opportunities with Lia

- Kendal Zimmermann SFCD kzimmermann@scfd.org
- Lori Hubert Brown and Hulbert LLP lhubert@brownandhulbert.com
- Mike DeJagger CSU, 551-208-9601

Finding people in the company you want to work in is crucial. Without having some "in" into the company your chances of getting selected is minimal. This was a great exercise and well worth it. Its kind of like testing, making me think about where I want to end up now as opposed to at the end of Turing.


####Collaborative Communication with Allison
for Rush Hour and Little Shop our teams used we used the full gamut of tools. From Waffle for project management, to Git Hub comments for conversations on the code we were pushing up. In most cases we dived and conquered the beginning parts of the project when it made sense to do so. As we got into more technical parts we tended to group together so that everyone involved could get a better understanding of what was happening. This was invaluable and made the harder portions of the project more bearable. Overall these techniques work incredibly well and there were little to no places where we ran into issues with each other.

Feed back is always interesting to get back. For Rush Hour We all had good things to say about the other members there was nothing really that bothered the group.  The biggest feedback I got was to not push to Master. I took this feedback and paid close attention to my branches in Little Shop. I know this is a critical skill to have and have made a special effort to ensure that I do not work on Master or even Development in Little Shop.

###Finding Opportunities with Lia
I love that Lia doesn't dress up the pig. Ya, networking can be a grind and boring but it is essential. Her pragmatic approach to networking was refreshing, realistic, and made networking less scary. The exercise we did of talking about ourself was uncomfortable but essential for me to get a better handle on how to talk to people about who I am and where I want to be. The class we had definitely made the prospect of networking at Rocky Mountain Ruby less daunting.

### Giving Feedback

-To Jean Joeris
Jean was a fantastic Project Manager. He was always willing to listen to our ideas (even if they didn’t always pan out). His patience with me made me mire willing to think about a problem and try to help find a solution. Jean always made sure that we were all working on the project and if someone looked to be disengaged he would ask what our thoughts were. I got stuck on one test issue and instead of telling me what to write, Jean just kept asking questions that lead me to the answer I needed. That was huge for me since it meant that I could better understand what had happened have a better understanding of the process The biggest thing I would suggest is to not lose the ability to include everyone in the group. It made a stressful project much easier since I knew that even if my idea was wrong I would not be belittled for it. That was the best part of the group.

-To Matt DeMarteau
Matt was an instrumental member of our Ruch Hour group. He was willing to take on the initial migrations even though he didn’t feel comfortable at the time with them and all the migrations were perfect. He was always willing to offer opinions on where to go next with the project and had an idea as to why he wanted to go that way, not just because he heard it from another group. Every time we split work out he was willing and able to take his share and get everything accomplished on time. I would suggest to not lose your positive attitude and willingness to learn. Both those qualities made the project much more bearable and working with Matt was an extreme pleasure.

-To Jenny Soden
Jenny continues to be a fantastic member of the Turing community. For the 3rd straight module she has offered to help me and spend time with me making sure I understand what is going on. She is always extremely helpful and willing to help anyone who may need a quick question answered. Jenny is an indispensable member of Turing and a major reason why I am still here. Even when she doesn’t know what the answer is she makes me feel like its ok to try something even if it fails. That is the biggest thing that Jenny does for me and why I am less hesitant to try new things.

-To Calaway
Calaway was a a fantastic project manager for Little Shop. His attention to detail and ability to delegate tasks was instrumental in our success in the project. His drive to understand the problem and to tackle whatever needed to be dealt with shows a deep desire to learn everything he can from his time at Turing. Calaway was persistent in making sure everyone in out group touched every aspect of the project. This was invaluable. I tend to shy away from tasks like styling and knowing I would have to do it was daunting but also made me think far more about it then I would have normally. One area I would suggest for improvement is styling. We are back end. It is important to know how to style but some basic bootstrap here and there is all we really need.

-To Brendan Dillon
Brendan was an invaluable member of our Little Shop group. His grasp of the topics, issues and, tasks was exemplary.Brendan’s ability to explain the task at hand and help me through a few difficult issues was extremely helpful. He communicates effortlessly when in a group and can succinctly express what he is thinking. Whenever I was stuck on something I could turn to him and ask. He would take a second to think through what was happening and then explain exactly what was happening.   He patiently explained how to fix merge conflicts at least twice to me which was wonderful to dispel some git problems for me.

-To Nate Anderson
It was a pleasure to work with Nate during the Little Shop project. Nate’s persistence in getting any problem completed was inspiring. He was always willing to take up any task that needed to be handle and alway had either a question to further the project or insight that helped us overcome a problem. There is only one thing I would recommend. The only thing both Nate and I agreed on was styling sucks. This is the one area I would say we both need to work on. the Rails side is relatively easy but style had us both confused and it would be worth it to take some time to learn boot strap.

-To Sonia Gupta
Sonia has been one of biggest driving forces of my ability to stay at Turing through a lot of hard times. No matter what is going on She is always willing to go for a walk and take time out of her day to help me figure things out. Talking with her has, more often than not, led to some breakthrough I would not have come to on my own. Her ability to understand any problem and persist until she fully understands it is inspiring and something I hope to emulate. She is an enormous asset to Turing and I am luck to know her and to be able to call her my friend.

-To Raphael Barbo
Raphael always has a smile on his face and a kind word to encourage anyone who he is around. His positivity and friendly demeanor has been of great comfort several times through Turing. His drive to learn more and to be better then the previous day is inspiring and being in the same cohort as Raphael has been a great boost for my outlook. He is a great asset to have at Turing.

-To Anna Dolan
It has been a pleasure to pair with Anna on several occasions. She understands what she is writing and how it relates to other segments of her code. I remember working with her on Enigma and whenever I asked a clarification question she was able to follow the stack trace and find the solution with very little prodding from me. She does tend to be hard on herself. She doesn't need to be. Anna will prove to be one of the better programs that comes out of Turing and her drive to know and understand the next piece will be invaluable as she progresses through Turing and into the job market.

-To Noah Berman
I was afforded the opportunity to pair with Noah several times throughout his time in Mod 1. Noah’s positive attitude has been something I am lacking and it was always refreshing to have that when we paired. Even when he is stuck on a problem he doesn't let it affect his outlook. His drive to understand the problem at hand is amazing and I have no doubt that he will excel in Truing and the industry as a whole. 

### Being a Community Member

Ben made me feel very welcomed to join the cohort at the beginning of the module, and we had the opportunity to work together on our first group project, called Rush Hour.  His natural ability to connect with others in the group, through respect and attentiveness, made him great to pair with.  Ben can handle any code problem or task delegated to him, as he did every night when we split up tasks.  I found him always available to reach out to when something came up, and thought his thorough communication with team members throughout the project led to our success.  Ben already has the skills necessary to work on any team and makes a great programmer as he continues his learning.
-Matt DeMarteau

Ben was a great team member. He has great perseverance and doesn’t fear asking questions when things aren’t totally clear. He has a very professional work manner, and always delivers things on time. Even when he needed to do something else it never affected his deliverables. On a personal level, Ben was very friendly and low stress throughout. The one area of improvement that stood out to me is being more careful about pushing to master. It wasn’t a common thing, and a little more mindfulness would probably go very far.
-Jean Joeris

It was great to work with Ben again on a group project.  Anything that he takes on, he dives deep into and learns everything about it that he can.  He was always willing to go the extra mile as well whenever we split up work. Also, he never shies away from learning something new. The recommendation I would give is one that I have given before, and I do think Ben is getting better at this, is to just not be as hard on himself as he is sometimes. He is a very good programmer and sometimes I wish he could see it himself. But other than that, he was again a great partner on another successful project.
-Nate Anderson

I have paired with Ben several times this module, and he has been more helpful to me than any other person at Turing. Even when I asked confusing questions, he always made an effort to help me find an answer. He was emotionally supportive when I was having a tough time on a project, and he has been extremely encouraging and generous with his time. He has also led sessions during Friday Spike specifically to help Module 1 students be familiar with concepts that aren't taught to us by the instructors. He is a great example of how to be helpful as a Module 2 student.
-Anna Dolan

Ben has been such an inspiration this module. He has helped me to overcome my own self-doubt and has taught me the value of self-reflection and community involvement. He paired with mod 1 students more than any other person in my cohort, and his willingness to lend a hand is truly remarkable. Turing is lucky to have him, and I am lucky to be his friend.
-Sonia Gupta

Ben has been a great asset to our Little Shop project. When he sets to work he is able to work quickly and efficiently toward a solution. He is very knowledgable of the material and is an excellent resource to go to with any questions. He has an awesome way of explaining concepts that you might not understand. He is also great at keeping spirits up with his sharp wit and sense of humor.
-Calaway

I worked with Ben on our Little Shop project. Ben is fantastic about pushing through and getting a lot of stuff done. He clearly understands how he works best, and was able to move waffle cards more quickly than a blackjack dealer. He also has the skill of asking the right questions when going through somebody else's code so that everyone in the group is able to understand it well. It is very apparent, though, when Ben gets frusturated with something, and that sort of very visible frusturation tended to infect the rest of the group. Still, Ben is a great person to work with and has a better work ethic than he gives himself credit for.
-Brendan Dillon

I could not go this module without giving Ben a major shoutout for the amazing work done during his pairing sessions, as well as seeing his dedication and willingness to learn more and more every single day throughout the module. I am super happy to have Ben in my cohort, and I honestly have a lot of admiration, and respect for everything he does.
-Raphael Barbo

### Playing a Part

- 16 pairing sessions
- 3 student led sessions

I was very nervous about pairing with Mod 1 students. I was not sure I would be any help to them and only de-rail their projects. Once I got into pairing with them it was fun to revisit Ruby and the "simpler" times of Mod 1. Since I repeated Mod 1 I knew a lot of the struggle people felt in Mod 1 and wanted to help quell those concerns as much as possible. I know I'm not the strongest programmer yet but I know how stressful Mod 1 can be for some and wanted to help in that respect as much as possible.
