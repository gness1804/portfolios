# Brian Heim - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to improve upon my Mod 1 performance this module, not only in academics but in community involvement and professional skills as well. In academics, I wanted to focus more on making sure that I truly grasped concepts and could easily execute new skills through practice and repetition. I feel as though I achieved this goal, and truly put in the hours and never got behind of the steady Mod 2 workload. In the community I especially set out to be more involved in posses, and ended up joining Armstrong after some encouragement from Jean, who had heard that I did statistics and advanced calculus in college. I am very happy in Armstrong and have attended as many meetings as possible. With regard to Professional Skills, I wanted to learn more about how to navigate the tech job marketplace. Lia's sessions were very helpful and outlined some great strategies to aid with the job hunt and getting noticed through networking both in person and on social media. Another goal for me was to attend the Denver Startup Week job fair and gain some experience talking to companies and presenting myself well.

#### Feedback for Brian

##### Positives:

Extremely positive attitude all the time. Throughout the project, no matter the pace or progress, Brian was very positive. He always said things like, 'Good job' and 'We are doing great.'
Very calm and even headed during stressful situations. Even when we were stuck on problems or behind our schedule, Brian always was calm. He never lost his temper at all.
Working with Brian made the me faster. He is great finding errors and issues that I may have overlooked as I was implementing a test or code.

##### Area of growth

I challenge Brian to apply more rigor to his hypothesis formulation and strive to eliminate some of the random guessing he applied to problem solving. While random guessing is a totally legitimate strategy in some situations, Brian will be better served in forcing himself to make a hypothesis or rationalize his guesses with data and/or technical knowledge.

##### Overall

The partnership was a positive experience. It was nice that the content was the hardest part of this project.

### Gear Up

I really enjoyed Gear Up this module, especially the last Gear Up: CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap. CODE was especially significant for me because I gained new perspective that I had not been aware of before. I have a fiance in tech and hear about some of these issue from her, but didn't realize all the ways that I can personally help fix the problem until this Gear Up.

Overall I learned alot about myself and my fellow Turingites during these sessions, and engaged in very meaningful discussions regarding these thought-provoking topics: 

#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to 10 interesting companies](https://gist.github.com/bheim6/ed3be7c390d1583c058745899e568434)

I learned alot about branding myself in the tech industry but really took away alot of information and tips for communicating and presenting myself professionally on social media. I already use LinkedIn but will now use Twitter as well to network and communicate with others in the industry. I also wrote down tips for keeping GitHub "clean" and also buffing it up with things like a personal site and a professional picture.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1 - Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?

##### The Good
* We used Waffle extensively as a project management tool during both Rush Hour and Little Shop. It was very helpful to keep track of the work that still needed to be done and organized it in a nice way that also integrates with GitHub.
* We instituted regular check-ins that kept everybody on the same page and aware of each team members' unique schedule and personal needs
* We kept communication lines open and welcome, which made discussing issues and being held accountable both respectful and actionable

##### The Not-As-Good
* I learned that I am not the best Project Manager. I enjoy using the tools and find them very helpful, but can sometimes forget to incorporate the tools into my regular workflow

2 - How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

I received some really meaningful feedback from my Rush Hour group that I can sometimes make guesses instead of making a better hypothesis whether or not a certain action will work. I found this to be very valuable and took this feedback to heart. I let my Little Shop group know that if I start going down that rabbit hole, to call me out on it. Luckily, just being aware of this trait has helped me notice when I am doing it. Recently I have been catching myself before it even becomes an issue. 

I have always valued feedback and encouraged it, there will always be more things that I can do to improve myself.  

#### Networking with Lia

I liked that we had to practice networking in this lesson. It really gave us some good practice before the Denver Startup Week job fair and helped me organize my "about me" shpiel by using "Who are you", "How did you get here", and "What's next?" as guidelines to drive the conversation.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Jesse Spevack

* Working with Jesse on his project has been a great experience, His major strengths are regarding his hard skills and ability to explain his thought process. He is a master of his tools and is adept with shortcuts and workflow. He is a strong communicator and is able to explain the reasons behind every coding decision. I learned alot about TDD form him on this project. I considered myself solid with TDD, but Jesse is an expert, and emphasized encapsulation and helper methods. It was really nice working with someone who was able to advance my own skill in this area.

* The constructive advice I would give Jesse would be to be mindful about managing stress regarding project deadlines. He never let it get in the way of the project, but could become distracted at times when overhearing other groups discuss how far along they were on the project. If he can accomplish this, he will be unstoppable.

#### Feedback for Bryan Goss
* This is the first time that I have worked with Goss, and it was a great experience. Goss is not only an adept programmer, but he is also very
personable and easy to work with. He naturally guided our workflow toward agile, he seemed to always create one thing at a time, and not move on to the next
feature until some effort has been taken to refactor. In real-time it just seemed like we were getting work done, but at the end of the project,
we realized that there weren't many refactoring opportunities since we had already been taking a significant effort to refactor during each feature. Our
project was very easy to navigate and edit, and alot of the credit for this goes to Goss. He is very knowledgeable about shortcuts and best-practices in
regard to code structure and syntax, and was able to explain his thought process in great detail. Goss was conscientious both when giving and receiving
advice or instructions to other members, and was accomodating of the rest of the group members schedules and needs.

* The only constructive advice I could think to give Goss is regarding styling. He is actually quite good at using HTML, but often expressed his disdain for CSS
and styling in general. While this is not an area that necessarily requires any sort of change on his part, it is an area in which some growth could be made.

#### Feedback for Chase Dunagan
* Having worked successfully with Chase before on Night Writer, it was easy to get right into the Norming/Performing stage. We get along well personality wise,
and I was excited to get to work with Chase again. Chase is a great team member and collaborator, and has a knack for noticing fine details. 
He facilitatedand sought out collaboration both when driving and when navigating. He also contributed alot to the chemistry of the group by keeping things 
light-hearted by cracking jokes and maintaining a positive attitude. Chase was instrumental in d-bugging code, often noticing error where the other group
members could not.

* Chase actively sought to drive and contribute in areas that he did not have much experience. I would challenge Chase to continue to do this, as well as take 
some time to do some extra exercises and practice, it will only serve to give him more experience and expand his abilities as a programmer.

### Being a Community Member

#####Overall

The partnership was a positive experience. It was nice that the content was the hardest part of this project.

#### Feedback for Brian (From Chase Dunagan)
* Brian and I have worked on a project together, before, and it went very well, so I was excited to get the chance to work with him again, but this time on Little Shop.  Brian and I click very well as far as personality, and I think we compliment each otherâ€™s programming skills, nicely.  Besides our superb ability to work well together, Brian was also extremely important to our Little Shop project.  His ability to think logically, and work out problems that were new to us, was very impressive. It was fun to work with Brian again and see how much he has grown since our first pair project at Turing. He continues to show why he is such a great programmer, and I envy any of his future group members, because they will be getting one of the most laid back, friendly, and  impressive programmers of our cohort.

#### Feedback for Brian (From Bryan Goss)
* Brian is very bright and good natured. I was very lucky to have him on my team for Little Shop. He always makes a point of suggestioning ideas as a question, to avoid stepping on toes. One small adjustment is that this habit eventually and in rare cases can come across as patronizing. Since I know what a genuinely friendly and kind person Brian is, I never took his suggestions that way, but I can imagine someone might in a different context. It reminds me of the Gear Up session about setting boundaries; sometimes it's better to be clear and direct. Overall, if I could select a dream team of programmers from our cohort, Brian would be on it. because he works hard and has fun doing it.
