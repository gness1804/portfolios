### Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this module are to keep up with the amount of material we will be covering, and truly understand Sinatra/Rails, etc. so that I can produce strong work this module. I also want to practice my HTML/CSS skills so that I can create aesthetically pleasing sites.

I want to get comfortable job searching and strive to work toward improving my networking skills.
