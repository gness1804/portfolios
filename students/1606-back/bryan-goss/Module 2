#Bryan Goss - M2 Portfolio

##Area of Emphasis

Unlike mod 1, I haven't used most of the tools that we encountered in mod 2. My area of emphasis has been to maintain a healthy balance between learning web development with Sinatra and Rails, along with picking up some machine learning from my time with Amrstrong posse.

##End of Module Assessment.

Sal and I were able to finish the two questions within the time limit. I received mostly 3's and some 4's. The main thing I should improve is to take smaller steps while coding. Write one test, and then one part of the code. Also, I let my experience with SQL bog me down when using active record associations. I can work on drilling active record methods more to alivieate that. Finally, Sal noticed that I laid out some options and asked him for his opinion about them, but suggested I continue to focus on improving my collaborative skills. 

#Individual work

##Robot World

Robot world was very helpful for practicing the different steps required to make a CRUD application.

##Blogger

From Blogger, I learned more about active record relationships and migrations.

##Mix Master

Mix Master was a lot of fun to work on. I solidified my understanding of relationships and I also learned about authenticating users with an outside source, Spotify in this case. Setting up Heroku and getting the Spotify API to work together with it was challenging. The API worked locally, but not on the Heroku site.

##Rails Mini project - Points Box

I was ill during the Mini-project and I regret that I didn't make more progress. It was a good experience for trying to implemtn Authentication and Authroization.

#Group work

##Rush hour

Rush hour was a difficult project. There was a lot to do in the timline. My group worked well for the most part, but there were a challenging points. AT this point I was struggling with active record associations. I am too accustomed to thinking in SQL, but Active Record handles most of that for us.

##Little Shop

My favorite project this module. I really enjoyed the project management parts. Getting new cards to work on every few days seems very realistic. My team worked very well together, I look forward to working with Brian and Chase in the future.

#Professional skills

#Technical Blog Post

#Lightning talk

I gave a talk about how AI and automation is making our job easier, and potentially so easy that devlopers may not always have a job.

##Gear Up
#Getting better at difficult things

As gear ups go, this one seemed extremely relevant to my daily life at Turing. The main take away is that the best way to get better at something is repetition with some kind of feedback to check your work. If you're just practicing in isolation, there's no way to know if you're improving, so feedback is important. Even skills which are difficult or impossible to describe to someone are teachable with this process. 

#There is an I in team

Setting boundaries is important. I would love to live in a world where people were as explicity about their boundaries as the person in the video was describing. 

#CODE Debugging the gender gap

I joined the conversation of people who want to be contientious of gender issues and take action to improve things. We talked about making diversity "everone's job" rather than having a single "diversity champion" on the team. 

##Professional Development 
#Finding Opportunities



#Collaborative Communication

The difference between Impact and Intent is frustrating for me, I almost always have good intentions, but I don't always have the impact I want to have. Impact often feels beyond my controll, but by using facts more than opinions or assumptions, I think I can have the impact I want to have.

#Networking with Lia

I appreciated the chance to practice my 2 minute story. I got good feedback from the people I talked to and it was cool to hear how people describe themselves. I need to do more work to find meetups and networking events to practice these skills.

##Feedback and Community Participation

#Giving Feedback
#Being a community member

#Playing a part
I consider my main contribution to the community to be my work with Armstrong posse. Machine learning is a difficult topic and requires a good foundation of knowledge. I've noticed the posse struggle two modules in a row to help new members establish this baseline. To help remedy this, I worked with Jean and Erin to develop a light "curriculum" I hope will help people get more out of their time with the posse.

Other:
For the first Friday Spike, I talked with some mod 1 students with Ben and we tried to help them settle in and get used to some of the tools they'll be using while they're here. Throughout the module I paired with Mod 1 students X times, particularly Brandon and Dan. The last Friday I will help with the Conway Game of Life coding challenge.
