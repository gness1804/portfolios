# Angela - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

It is known that the purpose for this module is make students employable, and my goal is to be just that.
I hope to gain an even deeper understanding of Rails and how to implement new features into a code base that is large
and unfamiliar. I hope to learn what else can be done in Rails aside from controllers, models, and views. I want to
be comfortable with pulling data from an API and returning data from my own API. I want to bet better at looking at
something new and figuring it out with the documentation. Lastly, although I believe I am doing well at Turing, I want
to discover and believe that I can do well outside of Turing.

## Work

### APICurious - Remaking Instagram

This project was an exploration into how to consume an API and read/understand the documentation that is provided. It was interesting because Instagram's API restrictions are pretty intense and made it difficult to return anything but my last 25 posts, even with another student in my sandbox. I was given the feedback to create dummy accounts with public posts to try to recreate the "feed" that way, which makes a lot of sense but didn't occur to me at the time!

### Self-Directed Project for OpenDoorLLC

For my self-directed project, I completed part 1 of the MVP for OpenDoorLLC. It was my first experience with a real client, and I learned a lot from all the small things they asked for that seem simple but aren't particularly easy to implement. I also successfully implemented the Google Maps API which felt like a huge victory for me because I tried implementing it with The Pivot. I was able to get the map to load in that case, but it was buggy and was misplacing some of the markers.

## Team

### Projects

Working in groups, I completed the following projects this module:

### The Pivot - LendingHands

In this project, we took Alicorn Adoption, a rails application for adopting mythical creatures, and turned it into a multi-tenancy microloan platform. This was a pretty challenging project, with the most frustrating part being having to rename nearly everything, but I was able to get a firmer grasp on Rails and database structure.

* **5: Queries**: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

### Feedback to Me

* From Caleb - I liked how you kept us organized and tried to keep us on task with the clients user stories. I think you left us behind on a few features, so try to keep others involved when you are working from home.

* From Lin - Angela is a task-oriented individual and did a great job keeping the group on track as the project manager. She could quickly solve the toughest problems and was reliable in doing so. My only suggestion would be consult with team members before making changes to the project as others were feeling left out of the decision-making, although I do believe she kept the team's best interests in mind. Angela is also very resourceful and did an excellent job applying new concepts to the project.

* From Tommasina - I saw Angela step up to her leadership role time and time again during our Pivot. She coordinated our work plan throughout the two week project, and helped us set expectations by delegating waffle cards each day. She works efficiently to get her work done and often works over and beyond what is expected of her in her spare minutes during the school day and for hours at night. She seems to me to be extremely proficient with the subject matter and she was a dedicated tutor when someone in our group needed help. I would like to see her continue teaching others, and to delegate more of the side projects/pull requests that she did in the late hours of the night. I noticed that I felt a sense of competition over who was contributing and I think it would have helped me feel like I was contributing more, if those decisions to keep working or to finish up cards had been made by the group. I understand we all had time constraints so on the other hand, I truly appreciate Angela's dedication to the project so that we could successfully turn in our fully-implemented site.


### Feedback From Me

* To Caleb - Caleb, I thought it was great how you showed your commitment to this project by staying up late into the night to make sure we were in a good spot for our final push on Thursday morning. You were willing to take on any challenge, and kept things lighthearted with jokes which made you easy to work with. You have a tendency to want to take on every challenge though, even when someone else is already working on it, so I think being mindful of this would reduce miscommunication and duplicated work.

* To Tommasina - Tommasina, I was seriously, seriously impressed with your code review. More than anyone else I have worked with, you reviewed the code in great detail, working through the changes and making sure they not only worked but were clear and offered great suggestions on how to improve things. I honestly didn't feel comfortable merging code unless you had looked at it, I trusted your review so much. I believe you kept us to a high standard and helped each of us become better with your review.
I also appreciate your equally thoughtful feedback, but it sometimes feels like your expectations are impossible to meet or confusing, such as wanting to drive but then feeling frustrated when someone is navigating, or feeling sad that a feature was completed without you. It left me feeling like you would be more comfortable with the group and the project if I did nothing, which I don't believe is how you truly felt.

* To Lin - Lin, your talent for design was so impressive! The platform recipient management page was my favorite one. And the quality of your code was great. You were very thoughtful about where things were placed and seemed very aware of how pieces were interacting. Whenever we worked on things together, you offered great suggestions that were creative. In the future, something to work on would be communicating more with the group about what you're working on, and/or sharing resources and encouraging a cohesive design.

## Professional Development

### Gear Up responses

**The Gender Gap in Technology**
This was my second time watching the movie. The first time I saw it, I think it made it more real to me how this is a problem. My only experience in the tech world before Turing was at a financial tech company where 50% of the leadership were women and the CTO, while a white male, cares very much about diversity in tech, and I feel very fortunate that I have not had to experience the things I've heard that women in tech experience. The movie made me think, yeah it hasn't happened to me yet, but it could happen, and it is happening to others constantly, and it needs to change. The second time I watched it, I thought more about how a big part of the problem was how women were being raised to think that math/science is too hard/not for girls. I did not grow up in the continental US, I grew up in an Asian culture where it doesn't matter if you're a boy or girl, you're supposed to be good at math and science. Maybe my upbringing is why it never occurred to me that I shouldn't be on this path because I'm a woman or that it would be more difficult for me because I'm a woman. The discussion after the movie was enlightening and my biggest take away from my group was that it's not the responsibility of the oppressed to educate the oppressor, and yet we so often have to. I also realized many women at Turing have the experience of being talked over and generally not listened to during projects and group discussions, and I realized that has never happened to me. I have been thinking about why that is, and if whatever that reason is can be replicated.

**There is an "I" in "Team"**
While I enjoyed the discussion with the other two people in my group because I like them as individuals, the topic didn't feel purposeful. I was confused about what exactly we were trying to get out of it. We did share what a successful team means to us, but we basically shared the same opinion on that. This gear up lacked substance for me, and I have not given much thought to it since.

**Getting Better at Difficult Things**
I think I am somewhat emotionally detached from my learning process, and that is probably to my benefit. When I am struggling with a concept or a feature, I can feel frustrated, but I don't feel sad or disappointed in myself or get sucked into thoughts like "I'm not good enough"/"Why am I even trying". But when I make a great leap in understanding, I make sure to celebrate. As far as what my action could be as a result of this gear up, I could continually strive to be more conscientious of the fact that some people do have emotional reactions to their workflow, and my experience with them could go better if I try to be understanding of that.

### Professional Development Workshops

**Flower Exercise**
This was a session meant to find our strengths and define our goals as they relate to beginning a career as a developer. I think my biggest takeaway was a discussion I had with a couple classmates about what kind of salary we should expect for ourselves. I find it interesting how much it varied. I think there is a tendency for us to think we can't or shouldn't ask for as much money as someone with a 4 year degree, but that is not true.

**Tech Interview Discussion from Ryan Tyer**
I felt that this was one of the most valuable sessions we have had. It is intimidating to think about what it is like to go through a technical interview, and Ryan's talk went over the process in pretty great detail. I also loved that he not only talked about what questions we might encounter, but also the goal or driving force behind those questions.

## Community

### Leading Golick Posse

I co-led Golick Posse with Roberta Doyle this module. While module 3 is an extremely busy/stressful module, I was able to dig up some resources for open source contributions. The most notable one was an RPG framework which a few people contributed to. I was worried that no one would be excited or interested in contributing to an open source project, but my takeaway from that was that people were appreciative of me spending the time finding a simple project to start with and people can be excited if you put in the effort to give them something approachable. We also practiced understanding documentation as we worked with the Amazon Dash button. We were never able to get it functional, but I'm excited to continue working on this and hope that we can get more interest/ideas about what to do with it next module.

### SAB

I was voted on to SAB for this module, and I have very much appreciated the opportunity to voice the concerns and feedback of my peers. Tommasina Miller and I create weekly surveys and try to come up with extra questions that are engaging and fun. We moderate class retros and try to really understand what our peers are saying and the reasons behind their words and communicate that to staff.

### Kids Who Code

 I help George with Kids Who Code every other Saturday! I love it. Those kids are brilliant and it is super exciting to be a part of a team that wants to nurture their desire to learn about code. And they're all *so* excited to show you what they've come up with. I wish more students helped out with it!

### Couples Support Group
I recently came up with the idea of having a monthly evening where students/alumni and their SO's can have a light dinner and socialize about the experience of Turing. It would hopefully give some SO's some context regarding how lonely they fill and also give them an opportunity to engage at a Turing event without the awkward feeling of not knowing how to contribute meaningfully to discusses that are tech related.

### Pre-work Guide

I am a pre-work guide for Amy Kitner, and have tried to provide good feedback for her and check in with her to see how she is feeling and what her concerns are.
