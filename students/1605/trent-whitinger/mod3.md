##### The Pivot Feedback

  From Matt:
  Trent, I really liked your idealistic approach to development. It was fun to be a part of and actually watch you implement it. I have to admit, I doubted you'd get the chat system working the first few days - not because of lack of confidence in your abilities, but more because everyone always claimed the pivot was super difficult. I was very impressed when it was done because it was something completely new that any of us had ever attempted before -great work. Some room for improvement as far as working in a team would be to just keep us informed on your schedule and when you're driving be a bit more vocal about your thoughts. Overall, these are very minor things and easy fixes. I really enjoyed pairing with you since we were always having a good time but also crushing it with our code. Good work and I hope we get to pair again!

 From Jenny:
Trent, it was great to work with you and get to know you better. You are a great problem solver and coder. Sometimes you have a lack of focus, and wonder off, but you always get your work done so I don't think it's a big deal. I'm very impressed that you did the action cable portion of the project by yourself.


#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Caleb9193/rails_engine)

RalesEngine was difficult and repetitive but caleb and I did excellent work and am most proud of this project in mod 3

### Giving Feedback

#### The Pivot Feedback

To Matt:
Matt you did a good job with organizing the database structure and planning out how we would develop the structure of our application. Strong knowledge of rails and pathing, use of slugs and building out controllers, making consistent and measurable progress. But you could of applied some of that tenacity to tackling new challenges and implementing features in javascript, don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly like an eagle, into the future.

To Jenny:
Jenny you did a great job as project manager instructing us to best practices and staying away from chasing rabbit holes and time sinks. As well as focusing on hitting the app specifications requirements. Great job leveraging your experience! But also don't be afraid to tackle new features or try things you haven't seen before with different languages because often they are a lot easier to implement than they appear.

## Review


### Notes

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3


* Final project was not what he expected. 
* Missed the key points of the project
* 2 for Individual projects - fell short on the personal project. Didn't quite hit the marks. Technically a solid developer but fell a little short on completetion and scope
* Suggest focusing on portfolio employer ready
