# CHRIS CONCANNON - MODULE 3 PORTFOLIO
***

### Individual Areas of Emphasis

The purpose of Module 3 is to prepare Turing students for employment. The focus is on honing the skills that allow individual success - seeking out ways to learn something unknown, performing new tasks efficiently and effectively, and becoming comfortable with constantly changing environments. I plan to focus on all areas which the Module 3 outline lists as outcomes:
* interpret a business need and develop a solid product using agile processes
* contrast the different approaches between working on greenfield and brownfield projects
* describe how multitenancy changes design in Rails
* construct a Rails app using multitenancy authorization
* use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM
* critique previous projects for fundamental security flaws and understand how to prevent them
* develop and test secure internal APIs using Rails
* consume external APIs and test the consumption
* describe what happens when an email is sent
* modify elements of the DOM using AJAX calls within a Rails app
* explain when to use caching strategies to improve performance in Rails
* explain the scenarios that would benefit from using background workers in Rails

## Individual Assessment

* assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/assessment.md#expectations 
* submission repo: https://github.com/concach/module_3_assessment

### Scores
**1. Ruby Style**
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

**2. Rails Syntax & API**
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

**3. Testing**
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

**4. Progression/Completion**
* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

**5. Workflow**
* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes

### APIcurious (bonus)
* assigment: https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md
* submission repo: https://github.com/concach/apicurious

I used APIcurious as an opportunity to explore several different API's, and I ended up building a project that consumed API's of both Strava and Google Maps. I extracted GPS coordinate data from Strava activities, and plotted those routes on embedded Google maps which were rendered using JavaScript. I was inspired to use Strava for my personal project, though in a completely different manner.

## Community Participation

### Feedback

I participated fully in my two group projects and I gave and received feedback in all of them. This feedback was given and received both in-person and through Sally. My personal takeaways are that I am perceived as distant, but competent. My group members had complete confidence that I would complete something when I took it upon myself, but I opted to work alone more often than pair with others. The times where I was around to pair with team members were appreciated.

## Professional Skills

### Gear-Up Reflections

I was not able to attend two of three Gear Up sessions because I was traveling during both of them - once to be a groomsman in my brother's wedding, and once to celebrate my birthday with a 4-day trip over Labor Day weekend. 

I did attend the screening of Code: Debugging the Gender Gap. I thought it was enlightening, but I was dissuaded by the provocative nature of the film. Some of the very dramatic claims about crash-test-dummies (that they don't represent women and children, and therefore lead to more women and children deaths) are actually completely wrong, and easily disproven by 5 minutes of google searching. Regardless, I found the video clips of conference openings and examples of misogyny completely appalling. I'm well aware of the historical shortage of women in STEM, but that inequality has already been eliminated at the undergraduate enrollment level. We as an industry are on the right path to gender equality.

### Professional Development

I began participating in recruiting events (Denver Startup Week job fair) and I have rebuffed my LinkedIn profile and resume. I have reached out to a handful of personal contacts about networking for job opportunities. I plan to continue my job search and professional presence over the intermission week. 

## Take-aways

This module, more than any other, was an exercise in time management and focusing on recognizing when my work approach was inefficient or ineffective. There was also a lot of time to think about principles specific to object-oriented programming - for example: telling rather than asking objects about method returns or attributes, single-responsibility in classes, limiting controller actions and instead using services or PORO's to perform tasks. This was also an opportunity to do some more front-end learning with jQuery and AJAX. I feel like I have a solid understanding of Ruby on Rails and I am able to critically view my own work and identify areas for improvement. I also have a much better ability to design a project at the start so that I don't find myself performing massive overhauls later on. I feel that I have performed my work well, both individually and in projects, and that I am ready for module 4.\
