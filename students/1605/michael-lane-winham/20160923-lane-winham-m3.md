# Michael Lane Winham - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

* I set out to grow and strengthen my skills that I have learned thus far at Turing. I also would like to improve my level of confidence pertaining to writing code. I plan to do this by gathering a deep understanding of the material through practice and repetition before moving onto the next topic.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluator: Josh

##### Notes:

* Made decisions based on perceived importance
* Watch naming of method names and variables


### Evaluation Criteria

#### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

#### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### 5. Workflow

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

* A large amount of the topics that were covered in the primary video really related to all that I have experienced thus far at Turing. It also gave you the tools to improve bad habits related to learning. Such as the pile up on b issue.

#### There is no I in Team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

* I did not attend this session but I reviewed all of the material covered in this session. I thought the topics pertain to boundaries and compassion were very interesting. It was talking about a give and take way to communicate and work with others without hindering you or them.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

* This was a great video to watch to show the real world, real time issues that are occurring in this industry. I know this has been a topic at Turing since the beginning but this showed me the whole scope of the issue.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Job Search Strategy Planning

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/job_search_strategy.md)

* Prioritize what you want out of a work environment and how to potentially locate that. How to revaluate and see if your criteria is to rigid or if the tactics you are using are not applicable.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/innovative-problem-solving.md)

* This session primary talked about ways to tackles interesting and new problems in addition to gearing us up for our brain-storming session for our person projects later that day.


#### Flower Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/petal-exercise.md)

* This sessions goals were to look at all the factors that I view as important in a company. By doing so I can clearing see  the things I enjoy at a job and things that I don't enjoy. This will surely lead to a more successful job hunt.

#### Interviewing

* I was unable to attend this session due to a pairing I had scheduled with Sally. I did look at the material and liked the level of humility that it brought to the idea of interview seeing as how I always tend to get nervous.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* To Roberta:
You did a wonderful job of guiding our group forward and consistently kept up strong communication throughout the entire project. I know we had many unforeseen issues during the project but you always handled the situation accordingly. One thing that I think could benefit you moving forward is to be extremely clear and straight forward in the DTR's. Not that you weren't this time but seeing the issues we had, I think if you incorporated a back up if group members decide to not follow the DTR and hinder the progress of the group. I also think you should strive to be the group leader! Your a very strong leader and have a clearly defined goal.

* To Deb:
Deb, you were an absolute pleasure to work with! You did a wonderful job of calming the tension in our group when issues came up, which speaks to the strength of your soft skills. I appreciate that you would also follow a task until the very end which is a valuable thing to have in another team member. I do think that you could benefit for being more assertive with how you would like to participate and provide to the group. I felt that you may not have gotten all that you wanted out of the pivot and by being more assertive, I think you would be able to get everything that you want out of future projects.

* To Nicole:
Nicole, there is no doubt that you are fast at solving problems and that you have a good understanding of how to quickly implement a lot of difficult functionality! I would only urge you in the future to listen to what your group members talk about in the DTR and how the group as a whole decides to work. I know that is not the style or workflow that you gravitate towards but I believe it is still an important part of this school. More specifically, I think you could benefit from slowing down and really trying to practice TDD in addition to git workflow out lined in previous material.

### Being a Community Member

* From Roberta:
Lane, you did a great job making sure that we followed a good git workflow. I enjoyed pairing with you,
Even if we had a lot of stressful situations during this project, you made things a bit easier by always being positive, and willing to work on whatever was needed. It was great to have your support and you as part of the team. You were also great about communicating when you would be available and when not. My only suggestion would be for you to be vocal about your opinions and ideas.
You also did a fantastic job with refactoring!

* From Deb:
Thank you for being a rock and cool head on our project. Your versatility and skill in coding & collaboration are so valuable to everyone on your team. Sometimes I wondered what you were really thinking - you can be a quiet one, but when you did express your opinions they were insightful and well-balanced. I hope you will continue to be outspoken. Your easy going and supportive personality made the long hours and project issues bearable.

* From Nicole:
You contribute meaningfully to the project, but I think you could have been more confident and taken on more tasks your own. You are capable and can do it. I wish you had more of a hand in the project, or spoke up about how you felt. Especially when the fighting broke out. Each group member should feel like they contributed and that their code got into the project. Also, I think some typing and workflow practices will help your speed. Aside from that, I think you kept a good attitude even through the rough parts of group work.
