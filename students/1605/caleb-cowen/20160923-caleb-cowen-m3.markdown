## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Apicurious

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/Caleb9193/apicurious
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md

## Project Description

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning these concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

As we build these features, we'll also be working with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/allindow/the_pivot
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md

Your Little Shop of Orders application was almost great, but it turns out that we need to pivot the business model.

In this project, you'll build upon an existing implementation of Little Shop. You will transform your e-commerce site into a platform that handles multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business will have their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

### Feedback to me

  Caleb, I thought it was great how you showed your commitment to this project by staying up late into the night to make sure we were in a good spot for our final push on Thursday morning. You were willing to take on any challenge, and kept things lighthearted with jokes which made you easy to work with. You have a tendency to want to take on every challenge though, even when someone else is already working on it, so I think being mindful of this would reduce miscommunication and duplicated work.

  It was a pleasure working with Caleb on The Pivot. He has the ability to focus on tasks and complete them quickly. My only suggestion would be to work more on refactoring and think about how others can work with his code after he's moved on. Other than that, I was very impressed that Caleb could find solutions quickly and with little aid. He mentioned that coding makes him happy, and I could see that when he was navigating through the project and solving problems with great use of TDD.

  I noticed Caleb working hard to listen to us in his group, adjust his workflow to meet our desired waffle workflow, and offer a willingness to allow others to drive and guide our progress. I would like to see him continue to work hard to give space in discussion to others, including when we are not talking about code. I find Caleb's enthusiasm endearing but I would also appreciate more opportunities to hear from members who are more reluctant to speak up in our conversation or group. I've found Caleb to be a more thoughtful group member than in the past, and saw that he put in very long hours for the duration of the project. I appreciated his new-found obsession with getting our test coverage up, and his eagerness to refactor our code even in the late hours before the project was due.

### Feedback to me

From David:
You brought so much enthusiasm and energy into this project.  You did a great job using that energy to propel the group forward to perfect the Ruby Gem.  You especially did a solid job with testing, by learning how to stub calls and how to test in Python.  When we started, you were especially pumped about learning Python, so it was a little disappointing to see you get derailed when we started the Python project and you realized it was a whole different beast than the Ruby Gem.  My constructive feedback would be to find ways to stay engaged sooner when you find something completely foreign, since it seemed to take you a couple days to get your momentum going again.  Overall, you brought a ton of excitement into the group, really helped drive our progress, and made this project a lot of fun.

From Zack:
It was great to finally get to work with you on a project. I feel like we have built a solid rapport with each other over the mods, so working with you was easy. You were driven and ambitious, and it was definitely infectious. Your good-natured attitude seems to know no bounds. Even when you get frustrated, you don't take it out on others. That's a valuable skill! It seemed like once we got to the Python though, you lost a bit of interest. I know you have a thirst for knowledge, and your persistence at crushing code is admirable. Keep that persistence, man! I know you've got it in you to learn Python and many more languages. I can't think of anything else you need to improve on heavily, you seem to know what you need to improve on and seek it out. It was a pleasure creating a gem (!!!) with you!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

I learned the importance of maintaining and reevaluating mastered skills.
It made me much more aware of my emotional state during studying and learning, and of things I did that used cognitive resources unnecessarily.

### Gear Up
#### There is an I in Team

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown

I learned the importance of setting my boundaries early in a group, something I've previously struggled with. I also learned to be cognizant of areas where I might be the problem or be contributing to a conflict

### Gear Up
#### The Gender Gap in Technology

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

I had to leave early in order to meet with my client for my project, but during the time I was there I was very struck by ways I possibly could have enabled or at the least, not stopped prejudicial actions by others. I truly hope to be more supportive and proactive in the future

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Jobs Chat

* [Workshop URL] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/jobs_chat.markdown

I learned several good strategies for job hunting and many useful tools

#### Job Search Strategy Planning

* [Workshop URL] https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/job_search_strategy.md

I learned the importance of timeboxing work in order to leave enough time for job searching

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback from me:
For Angela:
I liked how you kept us organized and tried to keep us on task with the clients user stories. I think you left us behind on a few features, so try to keep others involved when you are working from home.

For Tommasina:
I liked working with you and thought you really came into your own on this project. Your refactoring was awesome! The only advice I have is to try and not over complicate solutions to problems in your code. Try to look for the simplest answer first

For Lin:
I really enjoyed having you on this project. You had some great insights and your styling skills are awesome. Try to be more involved in the implementation of code. You have great input!

For David:
You were totally dedicated and probably the hardest working out of all of us on this project. Your work ethic was an inspiration to try harder even when I was having trouble with the code.

For Zack:
It was a blast working with you on this project. I could really see your enthusiasm and passion for what we were doing, and it was totally contagious. The only advice I might have is try not to get in your head when dealing with a problem. You’ve got all the skills necessary and more for the task at hand

### Playing a Part

I took part and am still taking part in a civic tech project in Pahlka, as well as helping lower mod students whenever I have the chance. I hosted several get-togethers for cohort members and tried to support cohort interactions as much as possible
