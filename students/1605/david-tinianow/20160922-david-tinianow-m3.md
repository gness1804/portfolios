# David Tinianow - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module has been to focus entirely on academics and get a strong grasp of the material.  I set too many goals for last module, and this time around I wanted keep it simple by focusing purely on learning.  Since this module was more open-ended than any other so far, I also wanted to find a mentor to help support my learning.  Finally, I wanted to make a point of getting more sleep and exercising daily, because both of those factors are instrumental to me being productive and alert.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

* [There is an I in Team](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I've actually read some of Brene Brown's book Daring Greatly, and so I am familiar with the concept of vulnerability.  One of my favorite quotes from her book is something like, 'Vulnerability is the last thing I want you to see in me, but the first thing I look for in you.'  I think it's a particularly relevant concept in an environment like Turing, which can be quite stressful and intense.  I think that learning to admit one's own struggles is itself a struggle, but important for growth and connection.  Many conflicts can be resolved simply by acknowledging openly and honestly how one feels.

* [Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

An interesting point in this movie was how women used to make up a sizable portion of the computing industry.  This fact helps debunks the idea that men are more naturally suited to programming, and suggests that the media and society played a significant role in steering women away from tech.  This is important to recognize because women now to have to overcome a stigma about coding, and may be inclined to downplay their abilities or affinity of tech, when they may be truly talented or passionate about it.

* [Getting Better at Difficult Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

One of my big takeaways from this session was that your environment and belief system greatly impact your ability to learn and excel.  It's also extremely important to take care of yourself and advocate for yourself as a human, and not let your coding skills be treated as a mechanized commodity. I thought it was quite ironic that we were watching a video discussing how developers have limited cognitive resources, while we are all enrolled in a school that necessitates working hours far beyond the limits of our own cognitive resources.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Job Search Strategy

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/job_search_strategy.md)

Since my goal for this module has been to focus entirely on academics, I have put off preparing for the job hunt until intermission week.  My goal is to use this coming intermission week to make solid progress on my resume, LinkedIn, and compile a list of companies that I would like to work for.  I will also be volunteering at Rocky Mountain Ruby, so that will a good place to start networking.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/innovative-problem-solving.md)

I did not personally feel this session helped me generate any creative ideas for my project, it seemed a bit too far removed from the nature of the personal project.  If I didn't work on the client project, I honestly have no idea what I would have built.  Perhaps the issue was the timing of this session, being right at the tail end of Rails Engine - it was hard to focus on anything else.

#### Petal Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/petal-exercise.md)

This exercise seemed pretty useful for self-reflection. I did not like that we only partially completed each exercise in class, since each time we moved on it felt like a deep reflection was being interrupted.  Regardless, this exercise working on this exercise in class was already starting to yield self-insight, and seems like it could be a helpful tool.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Pat:
It was really cool to see you take on totally new material in this project by diving into Javascript. You did a great job working on features independently and also did a great job consistently keeping us up to date on what you added. If there is an area for improvement, I think you could benefit from planning a bit more before diving into code. I would have also liked to hear you communicate your thought process more as you code, rather than explain what you did after it was written. Overall, your discipline, focus, and excitement for coding made it a pleasure to work with you.

To Yoseph:
You brought an open mind, a good sense of humor, and a lot of creative ideas into this project. I appreciated your willingness to try out new solutions and always have a discussion about what direction to take. Since you were the project manager, I would have liked to see you be more organized and take a more proactive role with the waffle cards and laying out priorities for the group. You had some really great ideas, but sometimes they were difficult to understand because they seemed off topic, sandwiched between a bunch of other ideas, or presented tentatively. I think you could benefit from learning to recognize when your ideas are straying off topic and find ways to articulate your thoughts more clearly and assertively. When you took on a feature on your own, you always delivered, and so you should be confident in your abilities. You are extremely smart, friendly, and curious, and I enjoyed working with you.

To Jason:
The amount of time we've now paired together on projects basically constitutes an entire month of Turing. What else is there to say? You are great to work with because you are easy-going, have a great attitude, and are always willing to put in long hours. My constructive feedback is that I would to like to hear more of your input and see you navigate more. Although you prefer to understand what's going on before diving in, I really think you could benefit from finding ways to stay engaged even when you are uncertain. An actionable step may be to take on the role of navigator more often while pairing, or if you are not navigating, stop and explain out loud what is going on to the other person. Overall, I've really enjoyed pairing with you and am glad to have had that opportunity. I especially appreciate that you are always willing to stay late to work.

To Matt Packer:
The thing I appreciated most working with you is your unparalleled work ethic.  You are always well prepared, organized, and fully committed to projects.  You also have a very methodical approach to coding, which makes it easy to understand your line of thought.  My constructive feedback would be to continue to find a balance between that systematic approach and getting comfortable with trying things that don’t have a prescribed way of doing them.  With that said, I definitely saw more of a willingness to venture into the unknown on this project than on Little Shop.  It’s been a pleasure working with you both times now.

To Zack:
You had a great attitude and brought a lot of positive energy into our project. This helped move the group forward even through challenging spots. I especially think you were a great pairing partner, because you were both patient and effective at communicating your thoughts as you code.  You also found a good balance between knowing when to work and taking breaks, which is under-appreciated, but helped keep us all sane and amiable.  My only constructive feedback is to make sure you give yourself enough credit since you are beyond capable and have the persistence to back it up.  You were an awesome collaborator, fully dedicated, willing to take on any challenge, and simply fun to work with.

To Caleb:
You brought so much enthusiasm and energy into this project.  You did a great job using that energy to propel the group forward to perfect the Ruby Gem.  You especially did a solid job with testing, by learning how to stub calls and how to test in Python.  When we started, you were especially pumped about learning Python, so it was a little disappointing to see you get derailed when we started the Python project and you realized it was a whole different beast than the Ruby Gem.  My constructive feedback would be to find ways to stay engaged sooner when you find something completely foreign, since it seemed to take you a couple days to get your momentum going again.  Overall, you brought a ton of excitement into the group, really helped drive our progress, and made this project a lot of fun.


### Being a Community Member

From Pat:
I think you did a great job with communicating, especially when it come to the responsibility of commenting on pull requests. Your leadership really pulled everybody together.

From Jason:
David was a tireless worker and great leader on the project. He kept everyone focused on git workflow and and really drove the backend development.
He was instrumental on really making the final push of this project, and his thoughtful observations were great for making sure everyone understood what was happening at all times.

From Yoseph:
Throughout the project I really enjoyed the foundation that you created in the group and kept the group moving forward. In the project you took over reigns that needed to be taken over and took charge of the project which was admirable. The one thing I could say for feedback, would be to keep an open mind and have fun with the project. I felt like it was causing a lot of stress on you, and I would've loved to see you enjoy it more.

From Matt Packer:
Throughout our project, you demonstrated immense dedication, ingenuity, and professionalism.  I appreciate how you took the time each to day to map out a game plan.  This helped add clarity to both our goals and progress.  Also, you have an exceptional ability to communicate your process and viewpoint.  You made our project decisions a discussion.  This helped us think through the problem at hand and develop a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish.  This made me truly respect your process.  For constructive feedback, I recommend you communicate your problem-solving preferences more frequently.  This would better help future team members understand how you can be most effective.  Having said that, you did a terrific job with communicating your ideas, process, and general preferences.  I really enjoyed working with you again, and hope that I have the opportunity to work with you again in the future.

From Caleb:
You were totally dedicated and probably the hardest working out of all of us on this project. Your work ethic was an inspiration to try harder even when I was having trouble with the code.

From Zack:
I'm glad I finally got a chance to work with you on a project. We seem to have complimentary personalities, so it was never difficult to work with you. Your tenacity and hunger for knowledge really shows, and you seem to have a healthy balance of patience and directness when you think things are going south, and I appreciate that a lot. Most people don't approach things head-on like that, and I think it's a great skill to have. If there's anything I could say you could improve on, it's taking a break sometimes! I know it really helps me rejuvenate when I get frustrated or can't figure out how to proceed. Since you seem loath to take time off, maybe have a side project or something to work on to get your mind away from the issue for a moment. In any case, I highly enjoyed building a gem (!!!) with you, and think it's a shame that we haven't worked together until now.
