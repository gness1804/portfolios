* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Notes from Andrew:

* Began to refactor - have a little inconsistency with modeling active records style.
* I like that you used a initialize to create all the methods you needed for attributes - being explicit is good.
* Hardcoded 17 total stores
* Good tests all around - did not complete the service test, but the feature test which integrate the service was really good.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components.

### 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I'm frustrated because to meet the requirements of this project, I had to steer away from something that would be useful in real life (or that I wanted to work on).
I took a risk using React, got components to work and it was not counted at all in my evaluation. I know it's out of the scope of the project, but I think that instructors should encourage and reward students that take these kind of risks.

#### Self Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/crowdchalet)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Notes from Andrew:

* Missing a few images on production homepage
* Good general UI on homepage - 2 options - very obvious paths
* Crashes when trying to create a group without logging in - just prompt to login if not logged in to do this function
* One of the core features is to search and it's a little hard to find that option - just make it bigger and more prominent
* If a feature isn't shipped - disable the path to the feature - joining a group crashed
* Overall UX is really close - I really like the general design and UI, some unpolished features like the group page make it a little clunky to work with - but it's really close

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

This project used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
I was paired with Lin, and our work dynamics worked really well. We got the chance to divide conquer and work separately on some queries, but also paired when we got stuck or while we had work time during school hours.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Completion
4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

## Technical Quality

### 1. Test-Driven Development
4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

### 2.Code Quality
4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

### 3. API Design
4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

### 4. Queries
3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.


#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

In this project, we build upon an existing implementation of Little Shop and transform an e-commerce site into a job searching platform.

### Gear Up

### Getting Better at Difficult Things
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)
* I thought it was interesting the idea of repetition to achieve mastery. We learn so many different things at Turing, and it made me realize the importance of taking the time to repeat exercises.

### There is an "I" in "Team"
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)
* Group dynamics can be difficult, and understanding everyone's perspectives in key. 

### Code Debugging The Gender
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)
* I did not attend to this Gear Up. I was extremely tired, stressed out, and I had a migraine on that Friday. On top of that, my husband was leaving for a conference for the whole weekend. He left work earlier, and I decided to go home to see him. 


### Professional Development Workshops

#### Innovative Problem-Solving Strategies
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/innovative-problem-solving.md)
Ask questions and discuss with group. Communication is key.

#### Job Search Strategy Planning
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/job_search_strategy.md)
Start networking. Some jobs are not posted online. 

#### Flower Exercise: Helping You Find the Best Fit
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/petal-exercise.md)
Reflect on the type of companies and jobs I'm interested in will help find not just any job, but the job in a place/culture that will help with my future career growth.

#### Interviewing with Ryan Tyer from Cloudability
Don't be afraid to ask questions and explain your thinking process. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Nicole:
You did an excellent job implementing all the permissions functionality!
The most important feedback that I would give you is to focus on testing. You wrote a lot of code without testing, and it made it difficult for us guarantee that we were covering all sad paths, and that things were working well together. Also, other members of the group ended up having to write tests for the functionality that you worked on. In terms of communication, I think that in this project you didn't do a good job communicating with your group. You were not responsive on Slack, and even made big functionality decisions without communicating/discussing with the other members of your team, and they were different than our user stories. In a real life situation, if we would have change the functionality of our application without our client input, the client would probably fire us.
I think you have the strength to move quickly through tasks, but I think that if you slow down your process, it will allow you to improve in areas like testing, attention to detail (indentation, code style, refactor, git workflow). The rush that we had at the begging of the project certainly hurt us at the end.

To Lane:
Lane, you did a great job making sure that we followed a good git workflow. I enjoyed pairing with you,
Even if we had a lot of stressful situations during this project, you made things a bit easier by always being positive, and willing to work on whatever was needed. It was great to have your support and you as part of the team. You were also great about communicating when you would be available and when not. My only suggestion would be for you to be vocal about your opinions and ideas.
You also did a fantastic job with refactoring!

### Being a Community Member

From Nicole:
I think that you're very capable. You aren't afraid to ask for help when you need it, and you contribute meaningfully to the project and you're good at testing and refactoring. I think you could work on listening and giving up control. The project is going to turn out fine regardless of whether or not we argue about it. We spent at least 5 hours arguing that could have been used on refactoring our code. Sometimes, we all just have to let it go. Put some faith that your group members can handle making decisions.

From Deb:
I really enjoyed working with you. You are a confident and tenacious coder. You never shied away from a challenge! Sometimes your passion leads you to frustration, but you are a person that works through conflicts with an honest transparency, which I truly admire. I was inspired and motivated by you, your problem solving process and your open collaborative style throughout our project. Thank you for your dedication to TDD and workflow throughout our project. You are going to be an awesome developer!

From Lane:
You did a wonderful job of guiding our group forward and consistently kept up strong communication throughout the entire project. I know we had many unforeseen issues during the project but you always handled the situation accordingly. One thing that I think could benefit you moving forward is to be extremely clear and straight forward in the DTR's. Not that you weren't this time but seeing the issues we had, I think if you incorporated a back up if group members decide to not follow the DTR and hinder the progress of the group. I also think you should strive to be the group leader! Your a very strong leader and have a clearly defined goal.

From Lin:
Roberta, it was a pleasure working with you on the Rails Engine project.  I was impressed with how well you applied concepts we learned in class the same or previous day, such as serializers, to the project.  One thing we both agreed to work on were the ActiveRecord queries.  They were well done, but could have used refactoring.  You have strong analytic skills and worked hard under a time crunch. I really appreciates how you helped me with a rather difficult query, and am proud of the finished project.
