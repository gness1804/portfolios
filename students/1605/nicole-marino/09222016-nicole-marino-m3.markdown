#Feedback To Me:

"You are an extremely strong coder and super productive.
 Sometimes your pace feels a bit rushed to me and your process without TDD can make it hard for others to orient to your work or collaborate easily with your process. 
 Thank you so much for working on so much code for our project and building many key pieces of functionality. 
 Really appreciated the times when you expressed patience and tolerance for different coding styles and personalities on our project."
-Deb, The Pivot 

"Nicole, you were a great person to work with though Sales Engine. 
You always listened to my opinions and made me feel heard. 
We were always able to work though what few differences opinions we had.
I would say, and you know, that you should slow down and read, and make sure you’re doing the things you’re supposed to be doing. 
In the end, it didn’t really matter and I am extremely happy with our team work and project outcome. 
Thanks for being such an awesome person to work with and be around."
-Jenny, Rales Engine

#Feedback From Me:
"You are very encouraging and positive as a person. I just wish you were able to contribute more to the project. It always felt like you needed someone there to help you solve issues, but that kind of mentorship isn't always available in the real world.  I hope next time you will speak up and request to drive, or take on problems on your own. If you aren't confident on taking on big portions of the project alone, then request to drive so that you don't feel left out of the big picture."
To Deb 

"Jenny, you are an amazing person to work with. You are laid back and low key, which is a super hard attitude to maintain in stressful projects. My only request is that you work on your confidence and optimism. Sometimes you would insult your ability and it makes it hard for everyone else to be confident in you if you aren't. I think you're great at what you do. I just wish your confidence were up to par with my view of you. Thanks for being awesome!"
To Jenny.

The Gender Gap in Technology
[https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown]

Took away that the we need to be more concious of the gender gap. Took away that 100% of turing agrees and not a single person has a different opinion. Will countinue to think about being more inclusive.

Notes

professional skills: 2


* Grew throughout the module made progress at the end
* Tried to work more as a pair - knows group work may not be a major strength - 
* Pivot - more isolated when could have worked in the group
* Decided to come back??
* If coming back need to focus on professional skills


Outcome

Pass
