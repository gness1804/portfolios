# Kris Sparks - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 3 I was very well organized and focused. My goal was to be as free of distraction as possible. I put 111% into everything. My goal was to solidify my understanding of the many of the principles, tools and concepts from module 2. I set out to establish a firm understanding of CRUD, RESTful routes, Rails, and web application development in general. Additionally, I worked to have firm understanding of building and consuming an API. Though I recognize that I can always improve and I have a lot to learn, I believe that I accomplished these goals to the best of my ability.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

####  CAMPFOUND - SELF DIRECTED PROJECT

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/campfound)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Summary: CampFound utilized the Eventful.com API to retrieve a list of festivals by hitting an endpoint determined by the User's search parameters. It renders a list of festivals. Each festival is displayed with a link. When a user clicks a link a query is submitted the Evenful.com API using the event ID and returns all of the details for that specific festival. As the show page loads a jQuery event retrieves the longitude and latitude parameters and passes the data to the Google Places JavaScript API and serves a map of campgrounds in the area surrounding the festival. Additionally, CampFound users can create an account and log in. The authentication is handled locally. They can also sign in using the Google OmniAuth gem.

Notes:  

Tests are fabulous.
Refactored code really well, still a little bit of opportunity to break methods out into smaller pieces but overall, great job
User flow is great. Able to get around the site very easily.
Opportunity to get pagination done on festival results in order to improve performance
Overall, great project! If I was a camper, I would definitely use it. :)

Summary: In this project we took a brownfield e-commerce site and built it into a new application while maintaining the original functionality. We transformed it into a platform that handled multiple, simultaneous businesses. This was an especially productive project for me. I got first-hand experience with more complex concepts including authentication, authorization, building a cart feature and robust testing.

### Work

#### RAILS ENGINE

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Summary: In this project we build a JSON API to expose SalesEngine data. We built single-responsibility controller with specific endpoints provided by the spec. We built the API in Rails and used ActiveRecord and SQL to query the database. This project was very intense and difficult. It was a great exercise in serving data and testing controllers when there are no views. I also gained experience with more complex queries using ActiveRecord and SQL.

Assessed by: Josh

1. Completion  
3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

1. Test-Driven Development  
3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

4. Queries

3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

Summary: I was not present for this gear-up. It has been made clear that this is not acceptable and I will make a concerted effort to attend all Friday activities.

### Gear Up
#### There is an I in Team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I felt like this was a productive Gear Up. Our conversation was about ghosts. Having a topic that wasn't code or workplace related made the conversation lighter and more enjoyable. We were able the bring the conversation around to pair project dynamics. Each of us was able to see another's point of view and how we may take on certain roles during projects. I thought about how I can be more sensitive the the work-styles of others.

Summary:

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

The film was excellent. It brought into focus a real and important issue. I have a very intelligent and capable daughter. I would never want her to be under the impression that there is anything she is not capable of accomplishing. While I think I am very supportive of and sensitive to all of my coworkers, it is always good to be aware of the difficulties other's may be dealing with.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Job Search Planning and Strategies

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/job_search_strategy.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-sparks-93a9b9122?trk=hp-identity-name)

I setup a LinkedIn account. I started working on my resume. In Module 3 I was focused exclusively on academics, but plan to start working on my professional assets during intermission week.

#### Tech Job Interview Talk

This talk was one of the best at Turing. It took the mystery out of many aspects of the interview process. It was entertaining and informative. I feel much less anxious about the interview process as a result of the talk. The section on the technical interview was particularly interesting.

#### Flower Exercise

[Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/petal-exercise.md)

This is one of the two sessions I missed this module and the situation was unavoidable. I contacted Alison immediately, and I apologized. I met with her the same day to go over the Exercise in detail. I have started working through the steps for the deliverable.

#### Innovative Problem-Solving PROtocol

[Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/innovative-problem-solving.md)

During this session we analyzed companies, the solutions they provide and issues those solutions may present. It was a good exercise in having to be objective. I realized that in many situations it is easy to criticize and more difficult to offer meaningful solutions.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

To Chris:
'Your contributions to the project were meaningful and significant. I've enjoyed working with you. I've also enjoyed problem-solving and learning with you. I think you have a strong grasp of many concepts and it would be great if you can continue to be patient with everyone who may not be as comfortable with certain things. I think you have a lot to contribute. It would be great to hear more from you in the early stages of a project. Thank you for all your work.' -Kris

To Karina:
'It's been great to work with you. You have a solid understanding of the concepts we are working on. You are always willing to help and answer questions and have a great attitude about it. It would be great if you can communicate a little more regularly about what we are working on. It would have been great if you could have participated in more of the project. It would have helped us learn more and taken some stress off. You did a great job of the aspects you worked on.' -Kris

To Zach:
"You did a great job as project manager. Your commitment was substantial. You communicated in a clear and concise manner. You managed the project well while allowing each member to contribute and be creative. Feel confident in expressing your valuable and competent ideas regarding the direction of any project. You have great ideas and will do well to take on more leadership roles. Also, continue to watch out for those 'rabbit holes' that we mutually need to avoid. You are an asset to our team and the community." -Kris

### Giving Feedback

From Susi:
"Kris is an unsung hero at Turing. He does more behind the scenes than anyone really knows. Not only does he help keep the space clean, tidy, and organized, he also reaches out to students constantly. He is always happy to help, offer a second set of eyes on a piece of code, or just talk through a complicated problem. It is people like Kris that make Turing what it is."

From Chris:
Excellent job with your group contributions and communication. You made the most consistent progress out of anyone in the group. I appreciated that you were willing to ask for help and/or pairing as often as needed. Thank you also for making sure that your pull requests did not break functionality and/or tests, and for regularly communicating with the group via Slack or in-person. I can't think of criticism for you or your work over the past 10 days, and I enjoyed working together.

From Zach:
Kris, your communication during the project was stellar - you were always available when you said you would be. Your coding ability is the same. You show incredible aptitude and hunger, and pairing with you was always a great experience. I think you showed a lot of growth in your knowledge, ability, and confidence throughout this project, and I'd love to see you take on a leadership role on a future project. I think that would be of great benefit to you, and one of your few shaky points. You were a workhorse, coming in early most every day and staying late several days. Your commitment to the project was admirable. don't lose that hunger, but also don't forget to take pomodoros every once in a while! Overall, without you, I don't think we would have gotten nearly as far, and it would have been much more stressful.

From Karina:
I believe Kris is one of Turing's most hard-working students. He consistently worked on diligently on our project every day until it was time to turn it in. Although non-stop work can be a strength, it can also be a weakness. I suggest he take interment walks to prevent built up frustration. Pomodoros are our friends! Other than that, I greatly appreciated Kris' contributions to our project, I truly believe that, without his hours of hard work, we wouldn't have gotten as far as we did.

### Being a Community Member

* Leader/facilitator: Hopper posse
* Leader/facilitator: Impostors Lunch
* Wall of Pictures

### Playing a Part

Every morning I try to clean-up the kitchen area and big workspace. I actively seek opportunities to connect with other students, both soliciting and offering help.

Hopper posse: As a leader in the Hopper Posse, I made myself available every morning from 8:30 - 9am for student-directed mentoring and pairing, particularly for Module 1 students. I assisted in problem-solving and basic skills. I know that Hopper was essential to my success during Module 1 and has been a valuable resource at Turing. It was beneficial for me this module because it helped me to think critically about explaining complex concepts - with which I am familiar - to students for whom those concepts are new.

Impostors Lunch: I was a co-leader of the Impostors Lunch where we discuss issues related to impostors' syndrome. This is a very safe environment where students can share openly. I learn a lot about myself from sharing and listening to other students.
